New recruits are taken in from second year only. The selection procedure consists of multiple rounds of interviews and discussions wherein prospective members aren’t judged on their knowledge of consultancy frameworks, but rather their problem-solving approach and whether they are able to present their thoughts in a structured manner.\\xa0  \\n\\nThe selection procedure evaluates the candidates on \\nStructured Thinking, Problem Solving, Work Ethic, Time Management,\\xa0Speaking, Writing and Design skills\\n. Good knowledge of business and finance is appreciated but is not the main factor of evaluation. We expect an optimal amount of time and dedication. \\n\\nKnowledge Meetings\\n\\nThe main opportunity to learn in 180 Degrees Consulting is via knowledge meetings. Seniors organise knowledge meetings to polish the skills of new recruits and also teach them various consulting techniques and frameworks. These knowledge meetings also involve case study competitions/workshops.\\n\\nOrganisational Structure\\n\\nAdvisors\\n consist of fourth and fifth-year members and are the senior-most members whose experience helps in guiding the overall direction of the organisation.\\n\\nDirectors\\n are members who are in their third and fourth year of study.

       " {'text': 'On March 7th 2014, during MT Hall day students damaged furniture, threw them from the top floor and made graffiti on the walls. In some rooms fans were also bent. The event was widely condemned by authority and student community.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1\\n\\nDetails\\n\\n1.1\\n\\nTimeline\\n\\n1.2\\n\\nA list of things that happened\\n\\n2\\n\\nAftermath\\n\\n2.1\\n\\nAdministration\\n\\n2.2\\n\\nEmails sent by the VP TSG\\n\\n2.3\\n\\nMeetings between the student community and the VP TSG\\n\\n2.3.1\\n\\nFirst meeting\\n\\n2.3.2\\n\\nSecond meeting\\n\\n3\\n\\nConsequence\\n\\n4\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n5\\n\\nSee Also\\n\\n6\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nDetails\\n\\nImages:\\n\\nBent Fan\\n\\nThings thrown from top floor\\n\\nVandalized bed\\n\\nThe hall day proceedings started at about 7 pm as usual. This was the first hall day for the UG 1st year students (who joined the institute in July 2013). A soft rule was put in place requiring girls who had invited their male friends to come to the door and escort them inside. This rule was not enforced very rigidly. Security at the gates of the hall checked the ID Card of every student who was going into the hall.\\n\\nAfter entering the hall, students were milling around for about an hour or so, understanding the geography of the hall presumably and taking it all in, because this was the \\nonly day\\n that they were going to be allowed inside the hall for the next 1 year. This was also the first time that they had a taste of the hall day culture. Much had been made of this tradition by most seniors from societies that about 1/4th of the UG 1st year batch were part of.\\n\\nAround 8:15 PM, trouble started when some unruly activities started on the top floor where some first year female students lived. Boys were being pushed out of the room and boxes of surf, tubes of toothpaste were being dumped and squeezed onto their clothes. Presumably, the girls residing in these rooms did not say anything to stop this distressing behavior (perhaps even vocally supporting it) and allowed the act to continue. Quickly, things escalated to a point where mattresses and pillows were being thrown from the second and first floors onto the garden on the ground floor which had been fixed for the Hall Day. Even until this point, this was nothing more than a joke. This is where the tone of things changed into a competition.\\n\\nMembers of various societies started forming human chains and singing songs and marching around the floors and the stair cases. These chains had both male and female members and they were going from a room of one of their members to another one of their members. Allegedly, all the members were from first year, and although seniors were residing in this part of the hall, they did not intervene.\\n\\nSome seniors from 3rd and 4th years were seen walking around the in the ground in the center of the hall where the mattresses were being thrown and trying to convince people vocally to stop throwing things and behaving in an unruly manner. This call to regain control and stop the events went mostly unheeded.\\n\\nThe whole destruction went on for about an hour unchecked, due to some gross mishandling by the MT Hall President, VP TSG and the hall security guards, who were present on the premises for the whole evening but did not act.\\n\\nAt 9:15 pm - 9:30 pm, the hall day was brought to an end (approximately 30 minutes before the scheduled end), and everyone was asked to leave. All the men were herded around and summarily expelled from the hall. The mood among most students was celebratory. It is safe to assume that the destruction that they had done and the consequences of the same had not yet sunk in. After the hall-day, discussion regarding what happened was mostly done with a fair bit of humor and the event was filed away in memory for nearly 2 weeks. Some girls whose rooms were trashed talked about how it was unfair for their LAN ports to be broken and their only fault being that they had invited their friends into their rooms.\\n\\nTimeline\\n\\nA list of things that happened\\n\\nFans bent out of shape (see image)\\n\\nBeds thrown from as high up as the third floor onto the ground floor\\n\\nLAN ports broken\\n\\nObscene phrases on the walls of some rooms (references to the male and female reproductive organs using slang terms in English and Hindi)\\n\\nAftermath\\n\\nAdministration\\n\\nAt the time of this event, the following were the people who held different important positions.\\n\\nEmails sent by the VP TSG\\n\\nThe Vice President (TSG) at the time of the incident was Apoorv Jain. On 9th March, 2014, he sent an email to all students enclosing images of the destruction caused. He severely condemned this event. The attached images immediately found their way to Facebook, and subsequently to Quora where several questions asking \"why\" these events had happened at a prestigious institute such as IIT Kharagpur. As most first year students were dazed by the destruction they had enabled and participated in, no one had thought or been allowed to take pictures before being expelled from MT Hall. Pictures that did exist had not been widely circulated or posted on Facebook. So, in essence, if the VP TSG had decided not to include pictures of the destruction in his email, there would have been none in public circulation for anyone to look at.\\n\\nDear Students,\\n\\nThis letter is in regards to the recent occurrence of damage to institute property on 7th March, 2014 during Mother Teresa Hall Day. In a span of fifteen minutes, furniture in the rooms of several first year undergraduate students was either broken, damaged beyond repair or thrown from the top floors. Furthermore, the walls were defaced with obscene graffiti. The fact that few students indulged in such act of vandalism reflects poorly on the entire student community of IIT Kharagpur.\\n\\nThis heinous act of mass wreckage showed lack of respect for institute property and, more importantly, lack of character and morals in the offenders, and has left the student community of IIT Kharagpur equivalent of street ragamuffins. This kind of crude behaviour as shown in pictures attached is not expected of students of the forerunner of the IITs. IIT Kharagpur is not a mere academic institution, we boast of a rich fraternal culture, which is developed through a deep sense of gratitude towards the institute. Sadly, incident like this have raised a question on whether our freedom is compromising our civility and whether we deserve such infrastructural facilities.\\n\\nWe, the Office bearers of Technology Students\\' Gymkhana and all Hall Presidents are extremely disturbed by this irresponsible and dishonourable behaviour of our own students. Visibly, students have failed to capture the real essence of Hall Days. We hope students understand the gravity of the situation and refrain from such undignified activities in future.\\n\\nThank you\\nWith Regards\\nApoorv Jain\\nVP,TSG\\n\\nOn 19th March, 2014, at around 8 am, he sent this email to all the UG 1st year students.\\n\\nDear Students,\\n\\nToday, Prof N R Mandal (Dean, SA) will address all the UG 1st year students regarding MT Hall Day incident. So, all the students are kindly requested to be present in Netaji Auditorium at 6.30 pm.\\n\\nThank you\\n\\nWith Regards\\n\\nApoorv Jain\\nVP,TSG\\n\\nMeetings between the student community and the VP TSG\\n\\nFirst meeting\\n\\nOn 19th March, 2014, the whole UG 1st year batch (students who joined in 2013) was called for a meeting at Netaji Auditorium at 6:30 pm. Apoorv Jain sent out this email at around 8 am that morning.\\n\\nThis meeting was attended by then Dean (Student Affairs) Prof N R Mandal, then President TSG Prof. Joy Sen, VP TSG Apoorv Jain and a few hall presidents. The turn out at the 6:30 pm meeting was very less. (approximately 50-70 people out of a total UG 1st year batch of 1400 people)\\n\\nThe meeting was delayed and students who were present there were intimidated into manually calling their friends to the venue, this marginally increased the turn out. The intimidation was done by the VP TSG who was present there, along with some fourth year hall presidents who were visibly angry and disappointed with the turnout. Absurd threats were made against the few obedient students who had turned up. Eg: \\nAgar tumhara pura batch yahan nahi aayega, to yahan pe jitne bhi log hain, tum sab pe DC baithegi. Phir udhar jaake jawaab de dena.\\n (If your whole batch doesn\\'t get here, all of you who are present here will be acted upon by the Disciplinary Committee. You can then explain your situation there.)\\n\\nAround 7:30 pm, the professors arrived at \\nNetaji Auditorium\\n. A long address followed. Students present at this meeting were informed that the 12 day delay was because of then DOSA Prof. N R Mandal being out of station and thus being unable to act on the events. This delay was not to be misinterpreted as an unwillingness to act. Allusions were also made to the VP, President and other professors of the institute getting phone calls from alumni regarding the MT Hall Day incident. One of the things that stood out at this meeting, which was discussed for several weeks after this meeting, was Prof. Joy Sen\\'s famous reference to the 1979 Mel Gibson classic \\nMad Max\\n. He particularly pointed out the end of the 1979 movie where Mel Gibson\\'s character Max loses control over himself, after losing his family, and kills several members of the gang that was involved in the death of his wife and his infant son. Prof. Sen\\'s was trying to draw an analogy between the behavior of a few out of control freshman and the protagonist in a movie who does something explicable, but rather bizarre. While most people at this first meeting had not seen the movie Prof. Sen was talking about, it was clear to almost everyone present that he was grappling with what had happened and trying to make sense of it using the appreciated principle of \"life imitating art\"\\n\\nStudents present there were also informed by the VP TSG that there was widespread disappointment in the behavior of the UG 1st year students, and that since the General Championships had been suspended right after the incident on 7th March, there was considerable anger among students in senior batches.\\n\\nAll professors present at the meeting were irritated with the low turnout and left about 1 hour after the meeting started in an agitated state. Apoorv Jain then decided to convene a complete UG 1st year batch meeting at 9 pm that night. There was widespread panic about what the consequences would be. There were several threats (such as mass Disciplinary Committee action, barring from placement, etc) which were indirectly made by the VP TSG and other hall presidents present at the meeting. The ultimatum was to get the whole batch at Netaji Auditorium at 9 pm and then, the discussion would be about the possible recourse that could be taken to mitigate the event\\'s fall out.\\n\\nSecond meeting\\n\\nThe second meeting began at 9 pm and saw much higher turnout, with almost the whole UG 1st year batch turning up. People were found in MMM and LBS Halls of residences literally running around calling their friends and everyone in 1st year to this meeting. There was widespread panic regarding the threats that had been made. Notably, none of the professors came to this meeting. The meeting was attended by the hall presidents of Patel, Nehru, MT, SN/IG, apart from then VP TSG. This was viewed as a scare tactic, as some of the hall presidents referred to the absence of Orientation Procedure / OP for first years was somehow responsible for this behavior. Their direct implication was that people were running around wild because they had not been \"trained in the ways of KGP\". Referring to the suspension of the GCs as a result of the main incident, one of the Hall Presidents said, \\nTum logon ko pata nahi hain ki iska kya matlab hain, sab log bahut gusse mein hain. Agle sal jab tum log senior hall jaoge to tumhe pata chalega\\n (You don\\'t know about the importance of the GCs being suspended, everyone is angry about this. You all will face the consequences for this next year, when you go to senior halls)\\n\\nSome of the options discussed in this meeting included a reduced community service for the whole UG 1st year batch, so as to save a few people from getting a lot of the punishment. When the students present in the auditorium were asked, \\nAre you all willing to take the blame and stay back and do community service for the summer, so that not just a few of your friends face really bad consequences?\\n, a few students immediately shot down the idea. The general consensus among students who had not attended the hall day, had not witnessed the incident, and/or were completely not involved in the incident was that they should not have to pay with their time for the mistakes of a few groups of people. \\n\\nThe VP TSG made an effort to try to get traction for the shared punishment idea. He asked if anyone would like to defend it and try to convince their batch mates. Understandably, students who had been spotted by many people as being the main players in the destruction were in total support of this idea of shared blame to reduce the punishment. They were seen visibly confused and voiced their concerns with one student standing up and addressing the rest of the auditorium: \\nDekh lo yaar, sab log lenge blame toh sirf ek mahina rehna padega, nahi toh pata nahi kya hoga.\\n (If everyone takes the blame, the punishment will be very less and everyone would have to stay back only for 1 month. If not, we don\\'t know what the punishment might be)\\n\\nTensions were even higher than at the previous meeting because for the first time Apoorv Jain said that one of the common punishments doled out after disciplinary committee hearings were \"semester backlogs\\n which implied that a student will be disbarred from registering for one semester and hence would be unable to complete their course on time. Apart from this, this would also be in the official record of the student including the final grade transcript.\\n\\nConsequence\\n\\nA group of 27 1st year students were told to undergo community service for 2 months during the summer months of May and June 2014. There was no other official record made anywhere regarding this event.\\n[\\nunverified\\n]\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThe events of MT Hall Day 2014 were a classic case of the Bandwagon effect. The destruction was started by a small subset of people attending the Hall Day. It started as a joke, and eventually turned into a competition between the various societies on campus.\\n\\nInterestingly, some of the women who resided in the hall, who were acting as hosts in the hall day decided to preclude the possibility of destruction by locking themselves inside their rooms and not letting anyone in. Some of the male friends of these women who had locked their doors to outsiders then tried to fish them out of there by filling buckets with water and then throwing them into the room using the slit under the door. It must be noted that a similar method is used to lure cockroaches out of hiding spots in kitchen drains, that must definitely have been the source of this particular strategy.\\n\\nWhile some other women decided to give in, and some even participated in the destruction of their friend\\'s rooms. Claims can also be made about this being a direct application of the herd behaviour in real life. There have been \\nseveral\\n riots in the past that have been attributed to this particular characteristic of human behaviour.\\n\\nOn a brighter side, there were people who were trying to stop this from happening. Shushman Choudhury (CS, \\'15) was on the ground floor and was trying to stop people from throwing down mattresses by shouting at them. He gave up after about 15 minutes of this (it was rather dangerous to stand on the ground floor where the possibility of a mattress hitting you is non-significant), but it must be said that it must have taken considerable courage to even try to do something like this against a mob, that for all practical purposes, had lost all control on themselves and had stopped computing the turn of events, the consequences of the same and the state of the hall as it stood around them.\\n\\nLess attention is paid to the aftermath and the administration\\'s response to this event. The administration decided to witch-hunt a small group of people and decided to get a list of names and proceed with punishing them. They decided to talk to the women whose rooms were trashed in an attempt to get the names of their male friends who did the trashing out of them. This strategy didn\\'t work out well at first. Most women flat out refused to talk. Soon, the administration started using the only chip they had: threatening the woman with disciplinary proceedings for not cooperating. Soon enough, it was clear to all the women that this was not going away and that they had to come up with names or get ready to face the heat of saving their friends.\\n\\nGiven a choice, several women chose to name a few friends who they thought would be wildly off the administration\\'s radar and it would be very hard to actually punish them because it would be obvious to everyone that these people were not responsible, but the administration didn\\'t care about this and went ahead and prepared the list of 40-50 people who were going to do the community service in the summer. This list had a few people who had been included because only the first name had been provided by the women and there were several people with that name in the UG batch. One such person got his father to fly out to Kharagpur and talk to the director directly about what was going on and why this kind of mob justice was being handed out. His name was removed from the list subsequently.\\n\\nThe names of some other people were also included in this list although their connection to the events was non-existent. People who had been at home during the weekend of the events or who had been in the hall for a very short period of time were on this list. Some people were able to get their names off the list.\\n\\nThe administration\\'s tactics were simple: they set about intimidating 18 year olds into tattling on their friends. While many might imagine that in the same situation, they would have behaved in an honorable manner, one is forced to imagine what the conditions must have been like if nearly 50 names could be squeezed out of a population of highly un-cooperative women.\\n\\nSee Also\\n\\nHall Day\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n↑\\n\\n\"Open Letter of Condemnation | MT Hall day\"\\n - VP TSG 2013-2014 Apoorv Jain\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=2014-03-07_MT_Hall_Day_Incident&oldid=97174\\n\"',\n",

       " {'text': 'Around 11 pm on May 14th, 2018, Security staff at IIT Kharagpur clamped down on a group of students who were trying to organize a protest. By all accounts, the protest was a peaceful one and was being organized to show solidarity with the students of Aligarh Muslim University, who were on a hunger strike against a laathi charge conducted by the police against them.\\n\\nThe protest was being organized by a student group called the Ambedkar Bhagat Singh Study Circle, IIT Kharagpur. This group is not registered with the gymkhana as a recognized society. They organized the event leveraging social media and a mailing list. The event was called \\nSolidarity Gathering for AMU\\n and it\\'s main aim was to show people around the country that students from all pockets opposed the laathi charge on the students of AMU.\\n\\nThe then-President of TSG, Prof. William K Mohanty, sent an institute-wide email with the subject \"Unauthorized Political Event\" saying \\nWe expect that students of IIT Kharagpur will not participate in any such event. TSG does not support any such activity.\\n Despite this email, the protest continued when 40 students turned up at the venue at the arranged time and tried to conduct a peaceful protest. Several SIS security officers (number unconfirmed) were deployed near the Gymkhana right before the arranged time for the protest. Photos and one video in which the security officer for IIT Kharagpur is seen screaming at a student who refuses to tell him his hall of residence was later published on the Facebook page of the Ambedkar Bhagat Singh Study Circle, IIT Kharagpur.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1\\n\\nTimeline\\n\\n2\\n\\nCommunication\\n\\n2.1\\n\\nDean of Student Affairs, Prof. Somesh Kumar\\'s comment on Facebook\\n\\n2.2\\n\\nEmail from President of Technology Students Gymkhana, Prof. William K Mohanty\\n\\n2.3\\n\\nEmail on a mailing list sent by ABSSC, IIT Kharagpur\\n\\n3\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nTimeline\\n\\nCommunication\\n\\nDean of Student Affairs, Prof. Somesh Kumar\\'s comment on Facebook\\n\\nProf. Somesh Kumar replied to a comment by Abhilash Gollapalle that said:\\n\\nIs this organized by the GymK or any other administration within IIT? Because I doubt if an individual or a group of individuals can speak for the entire campus or the official administration when they say that \"IIT Kharagpur stands with AMU\"\\n\\nHis reply was:\\n\\nNo this is organized by some anti-national elements.

This is to inform you that such events are completely illegal and have no sanction of institute authority. IIT Kharagpur is an institution of national importance and we do not encourage any activity which escalates tensions in the society in the name of political affiliation, religion, caste and region. Our sole aim is to promote development of science and technology and nationalistic fervour among students.\\n\\nWe expect that students of IIT Kharagpur will not participate in any such event. TSG does not support any such activity.\\n\\nBest wishes\\n\\nWilliam K. Mohanty\\nPresident, TSG\\nIIT Kharagpur\\n\\nEmail on a mailing list sent by ABSSC, IIT Kharagpur\\n\\nTime:\\n Wednesday 16 May 2018 09:22 AM\\n\\nSubject:\\n [spark] Attack on free speech at IIT Kharagpur\\n\\nDear All,\\n\\nThe Hizli jail housed in the IIT Kharagpur campus had hosted numerous revolutionaries who have laid down their lives in order to establish freedom and democracy for their motherland. The same campus witnessed a mockery of democracy when a peaceful gathering of IIT students was attacked by the security personnel of IIT Kharagpur. It all started with a circular issued on the 14th of May, 2018 asking students to obtain permission from relevant authorities before exercising their right to freedom of speech and assembly. Later, on the same day hundreds of security guards were posted at the gymkhana to prevent a group of students from expressing solidarity with the students of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) sitting in hunger strike against the brutal lathicharge carried out on them on the 2nd of May that left 20 students injured.\\n\\nThe circular issued by the competent authorities on the 14th of May goes against the student\\'s fundamental right to freedom of assembly and speech. The purpose of any protest is to voice ones resentment against the authorities in power and the act of asking permission for the same while facing threats and with all possibilities of a denial defeats the objective of such an exercise in the first place.\\n\\nIt needs mentioning that in the protest march organized for Asifa in IIT Kharagpur, a gathering of 400 individuals were restricted from raising their voices against the barbaric perpetrators of the crime. At a time when the entire country was standing for a cause, the students of an “Institute of National Importance”- IIT Kharagpur were asked to remain silent. However, the students without paying heed to the intimidating tactics of the administration completed a rally and raised their voices for justice.\\n\\n Be it the institutional murder of Rohith Vemula in HCU, the brutal repression of students in JU during Hok Kolorob or the recent harassment of female students in BHU (and in numerous other instances), Ambedkar Bhagat Singh Study Circle along with other progressive student voices have always protested against the silencing of democratic voices and the autocratic high handling by institute authorities across different institutions in the country.\\n\\n In the present instance, 40 students braved the threats from the Dean of Students Affairs to stand for justice for their friends sitting in hunger strike against brutal police oppression at the Aligarh Muslim University. The assistant security officer, Mr. Sushil Kumar Choubey literally went to the extent of heckling a student by force while he was trying to enter the JC Bose Hall of residence. Such an act speaks volumes regarding the undemocratic and intolerant attitude of the administration and the free hand given to security personnel to deal with dissent in the campus.\\n\\n Earlier during the day, the Dean of Student Affairs, Prof. Somesh Kumar labelled the organizers of the protest as “anti-national” elements and accused them of bringing disrepute to the institute. Unfortunately, such is the times that any act not conforming with the diktats of the ruling dispensation is termed as “anti-national”. The remark is not only derogatory but also exposes the extent to which the authorities in power can stoop down to harass students fighting for justice and equality. We strongly feel that even few years back “anti-national” was not a word that was used so casually as has been done in recent times. While Mohammad Hamid Ansari, the former vice-president of the country have stood by the protesting students of AMU, students from IIT Kharagpur in solidarity with them were branded “anti-national”. Is standing in solidarity with the students in hunger strike opposing against the entry of armed right winged goons in an academic campus “anti-national”? Will the act of ignoring the brutal reality of our times really make us better individuals?\\n\\n The mail circulated by the Dean of Student Affairs, Prof. Somesh Kumar accused the organizers of being politically motivated and therein he has raised his concerns regarding the affiliation of IIT Kharagpur being used for such protests. It is to be noted that in spite of the institute despising all things political, there are significant right wing activities going on in the campus and there are facebook groups using the IIT affiliation for the same.\\n\\n Next, while discussing the point of “activities that escalate tensions in the society in the name of political affiliation, religion, caste and region” it should be kept in mind that the different institute talks and lectures graced by different Hindu monks, promotes a particular religious belief and in turn vitiates the secular atmosphere of the campus. We are sure that there are good aspects of other religion too if AT ALL religious activities needs to be carried out in the institute premises. This kind of majoritarianism definitely adds in (if not escalate) tensions in the society. Next, when Darwinism is under attack, we definitely look forward to the institute authorities for the upliftment of scientific temper and critical thinking as opposed to the promotion of some organizations and individuals engaged in business models of spiritual corporations (read Art of Living, ISKON).\\n\\n Lastly, while discussing instilling of “nationalistic fervor” among students, we should always keep in mind that dissent is the cornerstone of a healthy and functioning democracy. An academic campus that doesn\\'t promote free speech and progressive thinking is definitely not dedicated to the service of the nation.\\n\\n Keeping the present situation in mind, we challenge Prof. Somesh Kumar to present us with evidence that proves that we have done anything that defies the Constitution of the country. Hereafter, we demand that -\\n\\n 1) Prof. Somesh Kumar must withdraw his “anti-national” statement and refrain from making such comments in the future.\\n\\n 2) Mr. Sushil Kumar Choubey should publicly apologize for arrogant behavior and manhandling of students.\\n\\n3) And finally, we urge the administration to re-establish the fundamental rights granted to all citizens of the country by the Constitution in the campus premises. \\n\\nSome images related to the incident can be found in the following link.\\n\\n https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zizNqebDMUeL_46Joqs8dHQI7-s4nxxi\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nTeam ABSC.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n↑\\n\\n\"AMU row: Tear down Jinnah\\'s portrait, says Muslim Mahasangh chief; up…\"\\n. 2018-05-17.

With this inspiration, we have started Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) Research Group in IIT Kharagpur. We aspire to make India’s first fully operational self-driving car.\\n\\nIGVC (Intelligent Ground Vehicle Challenge) has a huge international media coverage. Being such a consistent performer and from the esteemed IITs we will attract the attention of both the International Media, as well as Newspapers and Magazines within the country. We will ensure that due credit is given to all our sponsors, and our vehicle will have your desired logo as well.\\n\\nThe vehicle will be showcased at Kshitij, the Tech-Fest of IITKharagpur, which has a participation of 25,000 from outside Kharagpur. Other than Kshitij, we will showcase the vehicle at a variety of robotics exhibitions and workshops held throughout India. Additionally, the photo of the vehicle with the sponsors will be circulated all over the internet as well. Our team website would contain your company’s logo for the whole one year.\\n\\nIIT Kharagpur has immense talent of students and it will be mutually beneficial for the company to collaborate with us in order to attract more talent for their company.\\n\\nMahindra Rise Prize\\n\\nIndia has been on the verge of greatness for too long. It\\'s time to change that. It’s time to make the world sit up and take notice. To create disruptive solutions that transform lives. To lead in enterprise and innovation. To see \"Made in India\" mean best in the world. This is Mahindra Rise Prize challenge aims at. We at AGV have been selected in the first round of this challenge and we are looking forward to applying our technology to a Mahindra Vehicle making it fully Autonomous.\\n\\nIntelligent Ground Vehicle Challenge\\n\\nThe IGVC offers a design experience that is at the very cutting edge of engineering education. It is multidisciplinary, theory-based, hands-on, team implemented, outcome assessed, and based on product realisation. It encompasses the very latest technologies impacting industrial development and taps subjects of high interest to students. Design and construction of an Intelligent Vehicle fit well in a two-semester senior year design capstone course, or an extracurricular activity earning design credit. The deadline for an end-of-term competition is a real-world constraint that includes the excitement of potential winning recognition and financial gain. Students solicit and interact with industrial sponsors who provide component hardware and advice, and in that way get an inside view of industrial design and opportunities for employment. Team AGV has been constantly participating in Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition and making a mark.\\n\\nOur Achievements\\n\\nPerformance at IGVC 2018\\xa0:\\n\\nA total of 43 teams across India, Japan, USA, Canada and Istanbul had registered for this prestigious navigation challenge.\\n\\nOur team gave the best of the colleges which included the likes of University of British Columbia, Georgia Institute of Technology, Michigan-Ann Arbor University, Ohio University etc., a run for their money.\\n\\n7 teams from India contested in it including those from IIT Madras and IIT Kanpur. Team AGV finished as Runner-Up, winners being team CART Inc. at Bluefield State College, USA.\\n\\nOur Products\\xa0:\\n\\nWe have developed our own series of Autonomous Cars called ‘Eklavya’. Over the years we have put out Eklavya, Eklavya 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0. Along with this we are developing Auro 666 and a 3D mapping API.\\n\\nWe cleared the first three stages of Mahindra Rise Prize Driverless Car Challenge and have been awarded a Mahindra E2O electric car, which is being worked upon to be made driverless. The project has received a lot of media coverage and is one of the first steps by any Indian Company to promote the research and development in autonomous technologies.\\n\\nResearch Applications\\n\\nMine Mapping\\n\\nThe lack of accurate maps of underground mines frequently causes mine accidents. Hazardous operating conditions and difficulty in access makes Robotic Exploration and Mapping an immediate and safe choice.The mapping algorithms used in the self-driving car can also be applied for mines.\\n\\nConstruction Mapping\\n\\nLarge-scale construction projects might involve exploration of areas inaccessible or life\\xad threatening to workers. For such scenarios, a portable mapping solution could be hosted on a small flying quadrotor.\\n\\nCity Mapping\\n\\nThe traditional surveying techniques for generating maps for city\\xad planning requires thousands of man-hours and are very expensive. Large cities can be mapped accurately and efficiently using a self-driving car equipped with 3\\xadD laser mapping technologies. This can cut down on a lot of manual work and save time. With this view, we undertook the DIGITAL KGP PROJECT in which we mapped some parts of the IIT Kharagpur campus using the 3\\xadD ENVIRONMENT MAPPING Technology.\\n\\nNight Time Driver Assist\\n\\nThe use of special sensors in autonomous driving systems can detect approaching vehicles and road boundaries under poor lighting conditions. This feature could be widely used in vehicles as an essential safety measure.\\n\\nLane Departure Warning System\\n\\nThis system warns the driver as soon as the vehicle starts moving out of the lane. If the driver, for some reason, avoids the warning, the system takes over and moves the vehicle back into the lane. This technology completely removes the human error involved in the process.\\n\\nCollision Detection System\\n\\nA sensing system has a wider field of view compared to an average human being. It is also capable of running calculations at over 2.5 GHz. Owing to these qualities, a sensing system can warn the driver beforehand about a probable collision.\\n\\nCompleted Projects\\n\\nMotion Planning\\n\\nRobot Perception\\n\\nObject Detection\\n\\nLocalisation\\n\\nLane Navigation\\n\\nBranding Avenues\\n\\nOvernight hackathons and workshops in IIT Kharagpur\\n\\nThe product itself, merchandise worn by the team, banners, standees etc.\\n\\n15000+ reach through our Social Media, Youtube and GitHub Handles.\\n\\nResearch Papers and other technical publications.\\n\\nSponsorship\\n\\nWe are currently receiving funds through the Sponsored and Industrial Consultancy Cell (SRIC), IIT Kharagpur to carry on our research. These funds have constraints. As the sensors and other high-end technologies are quite expensive and cannot be bought solely through the funds from SRIC the team has to find alternative and cheaper methods to achieve what they want to. These methods are usually more time-consuming and less efficient.\\n\\nAlso the funds from SRIC cannot be used to participate in IGVC, since the funding cannot be used in travel and logistics which in itself require huge budget. Even this time the team funded themselves and performed outstandingly. So we have rightly shown that on being supported we will definitely perform much better and efficiently.\\n\\nOne example of our use of latest technologies on our work is the use of Velodyne LiDAR sensors to autonomously drive the Mahindra E2O car, which was highly successful.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAGV IIT Kharagpur\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=AGV&oldid=88112\\n\"',\n",

Students were carrying out internships in other countries. Mostly on their own initiative but it came to a standstill with the onslaught of World War II.\\n\\nIn 1944, the neutral Scandinavian countries were still exchanging students. In\\xa0Stockholm, Bertil Hedberg, an official at the\\xa0Stockholm School of Economics, and students Jaroslav Zich (of\\xa0Czechoslovakia), Jean Choplin (of\\xa0France) and Stanislas Callens (of\\xa0Belgium) founded\\xa0\\nAIESEC\\n. This was the predecessor of AIESEC, which was officially founded in 1948. At the time, the organization\\'s stated mission was “to expand the understanding of a nation by expanding the understanding of the individuals, changing the world one person at a time.”\\n\\nAt the time of AIESEC\\'s founding at the conclusion of the 1940s, Europe was in the midst of recovery from the war that dealt grave losses to its population. Factories and enterprises were in desperate need of executives, managers and leaders. The continent needed more than just business development, however; the war had severely damaged relations between European nations, and many members of the community felt steps needed to be taken to address this problem.\\n\\nAIESEC was formed to address both of these concerns. Students from seven nations:\\xa0Belgium,\\xa0Denmark,\\xa0Finland,\\xa0France,\\xa0Netherlands,\\xa0Norway\\xa0and\\xa0Sweden\\xa0came together in March 1949 for the first International Congress of AIESEC in Stockholm.\\xa0The founders composed a constitution for the new organization and defined a purpose: \"AIESEC is an independent, non-political, and international organization which has as its purpose to establish and promote the friendly relations between the members.\"\\n\\nIn the first year of AIESEC\\'s existence, 89 students were exchanged among the member nations.\\n\\nFunctioning\\n\\nAIESEC\\n\\xa0is an international\\xa0non-governmental\\xa0not-for-profit organization\\xa0that provides young people with leadership development and cross-cultural global internship and volunteer exchange experiences across the globe, with a focus to empower young people so they can make a positive impact on society. The AIESEC network includes over 100,000 members in 133 countries and territories. It is the largest youth-run organization in the world.\\n\\nSelections\\n\\nAIESEC\\n IIT Kharagpur conducts 2 selections in the entire academic year, once during the autumn semester and once during the spring semester.\\n\\nActivities in Campus\\n\\nAIESEC provides a platform for students in IIT Kharagpur, by going on an international internship. These young individuals can develop their leadership potential by working and leading teams. Associate membership opportunities allow the students to work with various NGO partners of AIESEC, and represent their college as a part of campus ambassador program.The organisations products are Team Member Programme (TMP), Team Leader Programme(TLP), Incoming exchange (ICX) and Outgoing Exchange (OGX).\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nhttp://www.aiesec.in/\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIESEC\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=AIESEC&oldid=9262\\n\"',\n",

It is a research group sponsored by \\nSRIC\\n as part of \\nCentre for Excellence in Robotics\\n. The aim of the research group is to drive the state of the art of aerial robotics forward and participate in international competitions like \\nIARC\\n. Students from all departments and years have been part of this including undergraduates and post-graduates. The principal Investigator for the project is \\nProf. Somesh Kumar\\n and it is mentored by \\nProf. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay\\n and Prof. D.K. Pratihar. \\n\\nContents\\n\\n1\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n1.1\\n\\nList of Student Coordinators\\n\\n2\\n\\nActivities\\n\\n2.1\\n\\nInternational Aerial Robotics Competition\\n\\n2.2\\n\\nAgricultural Robotics\\n\\n2.3\\n\\nTelekyb\\n\\n3\\n\\nTeam Structure\\n\\n3.1\\n\\nSoftware Team\\n\\n3.2\\n\\nControls Team\\n\\n4\\n\\nMedia Mentions\\n\\n5\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n6\\n\\nFurther Information\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nARK was an idea that started as a \\nDream-a-Bot\\n proposal which was an initiative by \\nTechnology Robotix Society\\n in 2013. The \\nTRS\\n heads then liked the idea and decided to go ahead with it and ordered a simple quadrotor chassis and ESCs worth INR 7000 only. With absolutely no prior knowledge about aerial robots or control systems, couple of students started tinkering with IMUs and ESCs spoiling them, burning them and eventually learning how to use them. However, a lack of direction to the project often demotivated the people involved. So, in early 2014, the direction was decided i.e. to participate in \\nIARC\\n which was a much further goal compared to the situation then. With newly found direction, the small group started with attempting to fly the chassis and almost got it when the ESCs and IMUs burnt stalling for months. In August 2014, one of the students bought an AR Drone during his internship.  This sped up work by a huge margin as students now could divide into two team - software and controls, the former working on the purchased drone and the latter on flying the chassis. \\nIn October 2014, the idea of \\nCentre for Excellence in Robotics\\n was floated and students working on this attempted to get funded through it.  Aditya Agarwal made a research proposal and roped in \\nProf. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay\\n and Prof. D.K.Pratihar as mentors for the project and applied for funding. Mrinal Mohit pitched in by taking his BTP on Visual SLAM from aerial drone under \\nProf. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay\\n. The proposal was accepted and the fund was received in \\nSRIC\\n in January 2015 and the group \\nARK\\n was officially formed. \\n\\nA complete lab setup was finally ready by August 2015 for testing drones indoor and finally a new drone with a new chassis was first hovered in the lab in September 2015.\\n\\nList of Student Coordinators\\n\\nList of Past Coordinators\\n\\n:\\n\\n2014: Aditya Agarwal (EC \\'15)\\n\\n2015: Soumyadeep Mukherjee (CH \\'16)\\n\\n2016: Gaurav Gardi (PH \\'18)\\n\\nActivities\\n\\nList of activities ARK is involved in\\n\\n:\\n\\nInternational Aerial Robotics Competition\\n\\nIARC is the longest running collegiate aerial robotics challenge in the world. Entering its third decade, the competition continues to tackle challenges that are currently impossible for any flying robots owned by government or industry. \\n\\nAgricultural Robotics\\n\\nARK is trying to use drones to use fly over agricultural fields to segment crop cycle times and also soil types with the help of Prof. Bhabani Das from the Department of Agriculture and Food Engineering.\\n\\nTelekyb\\n\\nTelekyb is a \\nROS\\n framework for aerial robots developed by \\nAutonomous Robotics and Human-Machine Systems Lab\\n at \\nMax Planck Institute of Biological Cybernetics\\n.

Azad Hall is always reputed for its stellar performances in Soc-Cult events, especially Dramatics and Choreography.\\n\\nLocation\\n\\nAzad Hall of Residence is one of the three halls in the PAN loop. It is the farthest from the institute main building and is the closest to the Tech Market and B.C Roy Hospital among all UG Halls.\\n\\nHall Council\\n\\nHall Council members are selected each year by the warden of the hall to ensure smooth conduction of hall related activities within the hall. These activities include Hall maintenance, welfare activities, grand dinners, festival functions, alumni meets, etc. Hierarchically, the Hall President and Second Senate Member(4th years) work in coordination with the General Secretaries(3rd years) and the secretaries(2nd years) to ensure the smooth functioning of the hall.\\n\\nThe Hall Council Members of the academic session 2020-21 and 2021-22 are as follows -\\n\\nHall Captains\\n\\nTo represent Azad Hall of Residence in the Gymkhana General Championships, every year the Hall Council Members appoint Captains of each event held in the General Championships. The Captains(4th/5th years) work closely with the vice-captains(3rd years) and secretaries(2nd years) throughout the event starting from selection of the event team to ensuring all activities of the event are conducted smoothly and timely. Captains bear the responsibility that best of the members of hall pertaining to the corresponding event participate in the event and perform their level best in the event.\\n\\nThe Hall Event Captains for the academic session 2022-23 are as follows -\\n\\nAmenities\\n\\nCultural Room\\n\\nMusic Room\\n\\nAuditorium\\n\\nLibrary\\n\\nBasket Ball Full court\\n\\nBadminton Court\\n\\nCricket Field for net practice\\n\\nFootball Field\\n\\nHockey Half court\\n\\nVolley Ball court\\n\\nTable Tennis Room\\n\\nGym\\n\\nWeight Lifting\\n\\nCommon room\\n\\nAccommodations\\n\\nThere are a total of 424 rooms for the accommodation of the students of Azad Hall, with 260 single rooms, 20 double sharing rooms, 142 triple sharing rooms and 2 four sharing rooms.

Blooming with it come the innocent first years, unknowing and curious to explore the beautiful campus. Their wish is fulfilled by the Azad hall of residence by organizing KHOJ, a campus treasure hunt for inspiring the first years to explore the campus with friends as a game and make it one of the most memorable event of their stay in IIT KHARAGPUR. It was started in 2000. KHOJ is the first and the biggest event organized exclusively for the first years. Boys and girls of the campus equally participate in it with full zest and zeal. The students are required to form a group of five, and then the teams are given clues of a place in the campus. They are required to unlock the clues, reach the required place and then find the code hidden somewhere at that place. This is done many times until a team unlocks all the clues and is declared the winner and prizes rain in the event with many teams getting prizes just based on their luck! Though the winner of the event may be one team but the enthusiasm the first years show makes everyone a winner. The event brings with itself joyfulness in the entire campus and gives a first year opportunity to interact with his/her batchmates and the campus. The event continues to grow every year bearing a testimony of the saga of the\\xa0AZAD HALL OF RESIDENCE.\\n\\nAlumni Contributions\\n\\n1)Mr. Supriyo Sircar(1987) - Basketball Ground\\n\\n2)Mr. Bhaskar Dutta (1970) - Music Room\\n\\n3)Mr. Subhendu Mandal (1995) - Football Ground\\n\\nAzad Hall Anthem\\n\\nAzad Hall of Residence is the only hall in IIT KGP to have a Hall Anthem and an Oath of Fire.

The credit contribution of these additional subjects to the computation of CGPA, however, would be considered as nil.\\n\\nThe GPA of the additional subjects is separately calculated and indicated in the grade card.\\n\\nA student can drop an additional subject following the proper procedure within 3(three) weeks from the commencement of the semester; otherwise, the subject will remain registered and the subject will be mandatorily reflected on the Grade Card even with F grade.\\n\\nThere is no scope for a supplementary examination in an additional subject.\\n\\nStudent can get \\nMinor\\n from other departments by completing required number of credits and full filling the requirements.\\n\\nMicro Credits\\n\\nMicro-Credit courses are one credit courses having duration of 3‐14 days offered during the semester or during evening or free slots available during weekdays or even weekends that are not declared holidays in some special cases when students are available.  \\n\\nThe subject will be counted for total credit requirement for completion of degree in special cases subject to recommendation of the Head and approval of Dean (UGS) with due reasons recorded.\\n\\nThe subject and grade will be mentioned in transcript / grade card and will be used to compute CGPA for additional subjects and will be shown as ACGPA. Failures will be marked by F grade. There will be no supplementary examination for such subjects. The F grade will be changed only if the subject is offered again and the student is allowed to register and clear the subject. However, in case the micro-credit is accepted as a subject contributing to the curricular requirement, it will be accounted for in the CGPA calculations.\\n\\nA student is normally not expected to take more than 2 such courses in a semester. The subject may also be a part of minor and micro‐specialization.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nUG Regulation Document\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Additional_course&oldid=19084\\n\"',\n",

It is a research group sponsored by \\nSRIC\\n as part of \\nCentre for Excellence in Robotics\\n. The aim of the research group is to drive the state of the art of aerial robotics forward and participate in international competitions like \\nIARC\\n. Students from all departments and years have been part of this including undergraduates and post-graduates. The principal Investigator for the project is \\nProf. Somesh Kumar\\n and it is mentored by \\nProf. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay\\n and Prof. D.K. Pratihar. \\n\\nContents\\n\\n1\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n1.1\\n\\nList of Student Coordinators\\n\\n2\\n\\nActivities\\n\\n2.1\\n\\nInternational Aerial Robotics Competition\\n\\n2.2\\n\\nAgricultural Robotics\\n\\n2.3\\n\\nTelekyb\\n\\n3\\n\\nTeam Structure\\n\\n3.1\\n\\nSoftware Team\\n\\n3.2\\n\\nControls Team\\n\\n4\\n\\nMedia Mentions\\n\\n5\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n6\\n\\nFurther Information\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nARK was an idea that started as a \\nDream-a-Bot\\n proposal which was an initiative by \\nTechnology Robotix Society\\n in 2013. The \\nTRS\\n heads then liked the idea and decided to go ahead with it and ordered a simple quadrotor chassis and ESCs worth INR 7000 only. With absolutely no prior knowledge about aerial robots or control systems, couple of students started tinkering with IMUs and ESCs spoiling them, burning them and eventually learning how to use them. However, a lack of direction to the project often demotivated the people involved. So, in early 2014, the direction was decided i.e. to participate in \\nIARC\\n which was a much further goal compared to the situation then. With newly found direction, the small group started with attempting to fly the chassis and almost got it when the ESCs and IMUs burnt stalling for months. In August 2014, one of the students bought an AR Drone during his internship.  This sped up work by a huge margin as students now could divide into two team - software and controls, the former working on the purchased drone and the latter on flying the chassis. \\nIn October 2014, the idea of \\nCentre for Excellence in Robotics\\n was floated and students working on this attempted to get funded through it.  Aditya Agarwal made a research proposal and roped in \\nProf. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay\\n and Prof. D.K.Pratihar as mentors for the project and applied for funding. Mrinal Mohit pitched in by taking his BTP on Visual SLAM from aerial drone under \\nProf. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay\\n. The proposal was accepted and the fund was received in \\nSRIC\\n in January 2015 and the group \\nARK\\n was officially formed. \\n\\nA complete lab setup was finally ready by August 2015 for testing drones indoor and finally a new drone with a new chassis was first hovered in the lab in September 2015.\\n\\nList of Student Coordinators\\n\\nList of Past Coordinators\\n\\n:\\n\\n2014: Aditya Agarwal (EC \\'15)\\n\\n2015: Soumyadeep Mukherjee (CH \\'16)\\n\\n2016: Gaurav Gardi (PH \\'18)\\n\\nActivities\\n\\nList of activities ARK is involved in\\n\\n:\\n\\nInternational Aerial Robotics Competition\\n\\nIARC is the longest running collegiate aerial robotics challenge in the world. Entering its third decade, the competition continues to tackle challenges that are currently impossible for any flying robots owned by government or industry. \\n\\nAgricultural Robotics\\n\\nARK is trying to use drones to use fly over agricultural fields to segment crop cycle times and also soil types with the help of Prof. Bhabani Das from the Department of Agriculture and Food Engineering.\\n\\nTelekyb\\n\\nTelekyb is a \\nROS\\n framework for aerial robots developed by \\nAutonomous Robotics and Human-Machine Systems Lab\\n at \\nMax Planck Institute of Biological Cybernetics\\n.

Subsequently on the upgradation of its academic programme, the department was renamed as the Agricultural and Food Engineering Department in 1994. Among the sixteen IITs, IIT Kharagpur has the sole distinction of having an Agricultural and Food Engineering Department.It conducts annual fest named Prakriti to create a platform for sharing ideas about agricultural developments from all over the country.\\n\\nAchievements \\n\\nTractor drawn combination tillage implements\\n\\nTractor drawn combination tillage implements are developed which can prepare the seed bed with less time, fuel and number of passes as compared to conventional tractor drawn tillage implements.\\n\\nEducational and design software\\n\\nThe department has developed a few window - based interactive software packages for use as teaching and research tools. These include Decision Support System for estimating Reference Crop Evapotranspiration (DSS_ET), Hydrologic Calculator to perform various hydrologic analyses and Soil Conservation Structure Designer to design various soil conservation structures. DSS_ET includes more than 20 ET estimation methods. It estimates ET and ranks applicable ET estimation methods based on data availability and climatic condition.\\n\\nImproved device for wet soil preparation\\n\\nThe traditional method of rice cultivation in wet soil requires 5-6 times ploughing by bullocks. The time and energy spent by man and animal has been found to be greatly reduced by the use of IIT Puddler. The machine can be pulled by a pair of bullocks and can cover 1 hectare area in a day.\\n\\nMechanized production of Indian milk sweets\\n\\nProducts like �Chhana\\', is the base material used for preparation of several Indian sweets like rasogolla and sandesh. A technology has been developed for continuous production of chhana by using helical tube heat exchangers and a whey separator. Sandesh, a delicious milk-sweet can be produced continuously by using a screw kneader and a vented single screw extruder. Untouched by human hand, the product attains greater shelf-life than those available in markets.\\n\\nTea cultivation in non-traditional area\\n\\nTea is conventionally cultivated in sloping lands and foothills. The department has developed technology to successfully cultivate tea in plain lands and wastelands by adopting appropriate land slope, drainage, plantation of shade trees and pressurized irrigation. With these management practices tea can be grown in lateritic plains and wastelands.\\n\\nImproved tractor seat\\n\\nA tractor seat having 18.9 N.mm-1 spring constant and 1.09 N.s.mm-1 damping coefficient has been found to reduce significantly the vibration and bring comfort to the operator. The seat has been field tested and recommended for Indian tractors.\\n\\nLow-cost polyhouse technology\\n\\nPolyhouse has been constructed for cultivation of off-season crops at controlled temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide inside the structure as per the requirement of the crops. The house can also be used to raise seedlings of vegetables and flowers. It is made of locally available bamboo and GI poles, mild steel flats and ultra-violet stabilized plastic films.\\n\\nAir-recirculatory tray dryer for fruits and vegetables\\n\\nIn an air-recirculatory dryer, a part of the exhaust air is recycled along with the ambient air. This gives higher thermal efficiency and produces dry products having low surface hardness and improved colour and flavor characteristics. The developed dryer can produce 2-3 kg dry products in about 6-7 hours. The technology has been transferred to SSP Ltd., Faridabad.\\n\\nRecycling of waste into compost\\n\\nWaste materials generated from agricultural, forest, aquatic, domestic and industrial sources are recycled and converted into compost. Different microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria and earthworms have been used as compost accelerators. The technology has already been transferred to Shewood Agrotech to commercially produce solid Vermicompost and liquid Vermiwash.\\n\\nBiodiesel production from non-edible oils\\n\\nA suitable process along with a processor has been developed to produce biodiesel from nonedible oils such as Jatropha, Karanja, Mahua, Simaruba with high free fatty acids.

Subsequently on the upgradation of its academic programme, the department was renamed as the Agricultural and Food Engineering Department in 1994. Among the sixteen IITs, IIT Kharagpur has the sole distinction of having an Agricultural and Food Engineering Department.It conducts annual fest named Prakriti to create a platform for sharing ideas about agricultural developments from all over the country.\\n\\nAchievements \\n\\nTractor drawn combination tillage implements\\n\\nTractor drawn combination tillage implements are developed which can prepare the seed bed with less time, fuel and number of passes as compared to conventional tractor drawn tillage implements.\\n\\nEducational and design software\\n\\nThe department has developed a few window - based interactive software packages for use as teaching and research tools. These include Decision Support System for estimating Reference Crop Evapotranspiration (DSS_ET), Hydrologic Calculator to perform various hydrologic analyses and Soil Conservation Structure Designer to design various soil conservation structures. DSS_ET includes more than 20 ET estimation methods. It estimates ET and ranks applicable ET estimation methods based on data availability and climatic condition.\\n\\nImproved device for wet soil preparation\\n\\nThe traditional method of rice cultivation in wet soil requires 5-6 times ploughing by bullocks. The time and energy spent by man and animal has been found to be greatly reduced by the use of IIT Puddler. The machine can be pulled by a pair of bullocks and can cover 1 hectare area in a day.\\n\\nMechanized production of Indian milk sweets\\n\\nProducts like �Chhana\\', is the base material used for preparation of several Indian sweets like rasogolla and sandesh. A technology has been developed for continuous production of chhana by using helical tube heat exchangers and a whey separator. Sandesh, a delicious milk-sweet can be produced continuously by using a screw kneader and a vented single screw extruder. Untouched by human hand, the product attains greater shelf-life than those available in markets.\\n\\nTea cultivation in non-traditional area\\n\\nTea is conventionally cultivated in sloping lands and foothills. The department has developed technology to successfully cultivate tea in plain lands and wastelands by adopting appropriate land slope, drainage, plantation of shade trees and pressurized irrigation. With these management practices tea can be grown in lateritic plains and wastelands.\\n\\nImproved tractor seat\\n\\nA tractor seat having 18.9 N.mm-1 spring constant and 1.09 N.s.mm-1 damping coefficient has been found to reduce significantly the vibration and bring comfort to the operator. The seat has been field tested and recommended for Indian tractors.\\n\\nLow-cost polyhouse technology\\n\\nPolyhouse has been constructed for cultivation of off-season crops at controlled temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide inside the structure as per the requirement of the crops. The house can also be used to raise seedlings of vegetables and flowers. It is made of locally available bamboo and GI poles, mild steel flats and ultra-violet stabilized plastic films.\\n\\nAir-recirculatory tray dryer for fruits and vegetables\\n\\nIn an air-recirculatory dryer, a part of the exhaust air is recycled along with the ambient air. This gives higher thermal efficiency and produces dry products having low surface hardness and improved colour and flavor characteristics. The developed dryer can produce 2-3 kg dry products in about 6-7 hours. The technology has been transferred to SSP Ltd., Faridabad.\\n\\nRecycling of waste into compost\\n\\nWaste materials generated from agricultural, forest, aquatic, domestic and industrial sources are recycled and converted into compost. Different microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria and earthworms have been used as compost accelerators. The technology has already been transferred to Shewood Agrotech to commercially produce solid Vermicompost and liquid Vermiwash.\\n\\nBiodiesel production from non-edible oils\\n\\nA suitable process along with a processor has been developed to produce biodiesel from nonedible oils such as Jatropha, Karanja, Mahua, Simaruba with high free fatty acids. The processor comprised a reactor, chemical mixing tank and a settling funnel and it can handle 10 liters of oil per batch. The yield of biodiesel is around 98% and the fuel properties of biodiesel so produced are within the biodiesel standards prescribed by India, America and Europe.\\n\\nMicrobial enzymes in food\\n\\nVarious technologies are developed and transferred to use microbial enzymes for clarification of apple juice, debittering of pomegranate juice and polishing of germinated brown rice.\\n\\nResearch & Development Facilities\\n\\nFarm Machinery & Power\\n\\nThe discipline has developed modern Tillage & Traction lab, Tractor testing lab, Ergonomics lab and Biofuel lab.

       " {'text': 'Alma Matters is a 2.5 hours documentary featuring the life of a student at IIT KGP. It attempts to cover most facets of student life in 3 episodes (discussed below).\\n\\nThe series tries to unfold issues less known to people outside IITs, and discuss cultural aspects specific to Kharagpur. Medium is a mix of Hindi & English, overall tone of the show is informal. Mode of the show is via student, professor & alumni interviews talking about their overall experience, or experience during certain events. The series features prominent comedian and alumni Biswa Kalyan Rath.\\n\\nThe documentary was released on May 14, 2021 and featured as the top watched show on Netflix for the first week [\\ntweet\\n].\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1\\n\\nEp 1: Independent Variables\\n\\n2\\n\\nEp 2: Escape Velocity\\n\\n3\\n\\nEp 3: Young\\'s Modulus\\n\\n4\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nEp 1: Independent Variables\\n\\nThe first episode talks about the motivation behind setting up the first Indian Institute of Technology, and what India expects of them.\\n\\nLike most number games, \\nCGPA\\n is a number that often controls access to resources and opportunities (defining terms like the talented \"chaggi\",\"satti\", \"atthi\", \"nehli\").\\n\\nIt briefly brushes the importance of halls in which the students spent most of their college life, and the motivation towards winning the prestigious \\nGeneral Championships (GC)\\n.\\n\\nExplains the \\nstudent committee\\n, its election and their role in organising on-campus activities like GC.\\n\\nExplores the gender ratio on campus (1 girl :9 boy), and how it creates a sexist bias towards dismissing women\\'s opinions on campus\\n\\nWhy there was never a girl candidate contested for the highest student post, Vice President of Gymkhana.\\n\\nHaving a girl candidate contest for the post and win Secretary Sports and Games, and what challenges / bias the candidate faced.\\n\\nEp 2: Escape Velocity\\n\\nEpisode 2 largely covers the placement process for final year students, what kind of stress that brings - it closely follows few students living in the same wing, and them getting placed.\\n\\nOne of the highly appreciated points about the episode has been its honest depiction regarding placement packages and the proverbial \"1 crore package\" - which 5 students of a batch of 2000 receive, while most students land a package of 8-12 lakhs.\\n\\nDisparity among hiring companies - most companies hire for a data profile, and people keep their course work for 4/5 years aside and prepare for a job that their academic work does not necessarily prepare them for.\\n\\nCompanies hiring for \"core profile\" (directly related to study / department) are few and hire a handful of students - the rest of students are not left with options.\\n\\nEp 3: Young\\'s Modulus\\n\\nThe final episode of the series starts with one of the most significant cultural experiences in KGP - \\nIllu\\n and \\nRangoli\\n.\\n\\nDuring the two semesters when the documentary was filmed (2017), the campus had 5 suicides in one year, the show covers the open house held to address this and the concerns for mental health.\\n\\nThe series ends with the final few days of students before they graduate - and enter a world they have tried to prepared for.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nIMDB page\\n\\nNetflix page\\n\\nYoutube trailer\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Alma_Matters&oldid=146284\\n\"',\n",

The course uses Android as a platform for development because it’s modern and has an easy to use graphical interface.\\n\\nProgram Description\\n\\nCourse Format\\n\\nThe program employs a flipped classroom educational model. Students prepare independently by reading and setting up software such that they\\'re ready for the in-person workshop sessions, which consist of larger programming exercises completed in pairs with the support of facilitators. Activities will also contain optional extensions; if time permits each pair will complete at least one, further customizing their work.\\n\\nCourse Delivery\\n\\nApplied CS consists of six core technical units which can be delivered in a variety of formats. Each unit will require some preparation that the students complete at their own pace via self-study, to maximize the productivity of the in-person time during the workshops. This preparation will consist of relevant readings, software setups and smaller programming activities. Each workshop will consist of larger programming exercises that students complete in pairs, with the support of facilitators in selected universities. The workshop activities also include optional extensions.\\n\\nSyllabus\\n\\n*  Unit A: Scarne\\'s Dice with App Inventor (optional) Getting started with Android development\\n*  Unit 1: Anagrams Using Java in Android Studio\\n*  Unit 2: Scarne\\'s Dice Creating an new Android app in Android Studio\\n*  Unit 3: Ghost A review of binary search\\n*  Unit 4: Ghost II Tree traversals and tries\\n*  Unit 5: Puzzle-8 Using min-heaps\\n*  Unit 6: Code Sprint\\n*  Unit 7: Word Ladder Graphs and Graph Traversal\\n*  Unit 8: Black Hole Monte Carlo and Unit Testing\\n*  Unit 9: Continental Divide Dynamic Programming\\n*  Post Assessment\\n*  Post Course Student Survey\\n\\nContact\\n\\nEmail ID\\n\\n[email\\xa0protected]\\n\\nFacilitators\\n\\nWorkshop Date\\n\\nTo be announced.\\n\\nSurvey form\\n\\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/LH4ShNmA7rYASEN93\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nGuide on How to Disable Android Auto by GeniusGeeks\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Applied_CS_with_Android&oldid=146348\\n\"',\n",

Progress reaches the society only when change is observed. \\nAwaaz has tried to bring a change in the institute and students’ lives every then and now. Some of the initiatives have been described below:\\n\\nSting Operation on Passport Bribery Case:\\n A common complaint of the police officers asking for bribes was reported by a lot of students. The bribe amount varied from around 200 to 500 rupees. Awaaz conducted a sting operation and recorded the incident stealthily. The recording along with the report of a survey conducted by Awaaz was submitted to the concerned authorities and bribery was almost curbed.\\n\\nCV Module:\\n When the ERP-based CV Module was newly introduced in the institute, the students faced a lot of problems due to the highly inefficient and buggy platform on which they were supposed to make their CV. Awaaz conducted a survey and prepared a report to submit to the administration. The report was considered by the administration and the CV Module was halted for a few days to come up with a better version of the same.\\n\\nSecurity Issue:\\n In 2016, the campus had way too less number of security guards and CCTV Cameras. The report submitted by Awaaz regarding the same was considered and led to a lot of changes on the security front in the campus.\\n\\nCleanliness Issue:\\n On the behalf of the entire student community, Awaaz demanded an increase in the number of dustbins in the campus and use of steel dustbins instead of plastic ones. The struggle bore fruits and the requests were considered by the institute.\\n\\nEvents Conducted\\n\\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur conducts two events in the span of one year:\\n\\nPanch Parmeshwar:\\n\\nIn the splendour of Spring Fest, Awaaz conducts ‘Panch Parmeshwar’, an event that attempts to bring the funniest and most delightful village memories back for the students. The participating teams are presented with an amusing and tangled case and the dispute is led to the Panchayat where they have to win the case by defending their side through relevant and humorous arguments. \\n\\nKavyanjali:\\n\\nPoets across the nation gather together for a poetic evening at the campus!\\n\\nSelection Procedure\\n\\nSelections to Team Awaaz are held once every year, for both first and second year students, in the month of August. Awaaz selects around 25 students in total just after the Freshers’ Introductory Seminar. The selection procedure consists of a group discussion task and a written test followed by a personal interview.\\n\\nAlumni of Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur\\n\\nExternal Links\\n\\nhttps://facebook.com/awaaziitkgp\\n\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/awaaziitkgp\\n\\nhttps://youtube.com/user/awaaziitkgp\\n\\nhttps://issuu.com/awaaz\\n\\nhttps://linkedin.com/company/awaaz-iit-kharagpur\\n\\nContact us\\n\\nPhone No: Rishabh Raj\\xa0: 9117337131\\n\\nEmail: \\n[email\\xa0protected]\\n OR \\n[email\\xa0protected]\\n\\nEmail: \\n[email\\xa0protected]\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Awaaz&oldid=238409\\n\"',\n",

Blooming with it come the innocent first years, unknowing and curious to explore the beautiful campus. Their wish is fulfilled by the Azad hall of residence by organizing KHOJ, a campus treasure hunt for inspiring the first years to explore the campus with friends as a game and make it one of the most memorable event of their stay in IIT KHARAGPUR. It was started in 2000. KHOJ is the first and the biggest event organized exclusively for the first years. Boys and girls of the campus equally participate in it with full zest and zeal. The students are required to form a group of five, and then the teams are given clues of a place in the campus. They are required to unlock the clues, reach the required place and then find the code hidden somewhere at that place. This is done many times until a team unlocks all the clues and is declared the winner and prizes rain in the event with many teams getting prizes just based on their luck! Though the winner of the event may be one team but the enthusiasm the first years show makes everyone a winner. The event brings with itself joyfulness in the entire campus and gives a first year opportunity to interact with his/her batchmates and the campus. The event continues to grow every year bearing a testimony of the saga of the\\xa0AZAD HALL OF RESIDENCE.\\n\\nAlumni Contributions\\n\\n1)Mr. Supriyo Sircar(1987) - Basketball Ground\\n\\n2)Mr. Bhaskar Dutta (1970) - Music Room\\n\\n3)Mr. Subhendu Mandal (1995) - Football Ground\\n\\nAzad Hall Anthem\\n\\nAzad Hall of Residence is the only hall in IIT KGP to have a Hall Anthem and an Oath of Fire.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Azad_Hall_of_Residence&oldid=238479\\n\"',\n",

Genesie-de-Strategie was started with a primary objective to educate the students about the world of business strategies. The founders felt a need for students to be informed about the working of the business world for their growth. Over the course of a year, they realised the need to have a more wholesome approach to the world of business. They formed the Business Club in 2010 with a broader perspective toward business.\\n\\nGrowth\\n\\nIndian Case Challenge,\\n India’s largest case competition, is the flagship event of the Business Club. ICC now witnesses international participation as well.\\n\\nAffiliation to Technology Students’ Gymkhana\\n (during the academic session 2014-15) brought official recognition to the club.\\n\\nThe Business Club has started to reach out to the entire student population of the college by conducting \\nOpen House Sessions\\n for their benefit.\\n\\nRegular \\nsocial media content\\n and \\nblogs\\n in the domain of finance, strategy and analytics are uploaded on all major social media platforms to keep readers updated.\\n\\nFunctioning\\n\\nSelections\\n\\nSelections to the Business Club are held at the beginning of the first and the second academic year.\\n\\nFirst-year selections\\n\\nThe selection procedure consists of a \\ngroup-discussion\\n round followed by a personal \\ninterview\\n for the shortlisted candidates. Prospective members aren’t judged based on their business acumen, but on their ability to think clearly, present thoughts in a concise and structured manner, their dedication, and their zeal to learn.\\n\\nSecond-year selections\\n\\nA training period called the \\nsummer program\\n is conducted for the students selected in the second academic year to level their knowledge with the students selected in the first year. During this time, they are provided with the same resources to learn everything necessary. \\n\\nAfter the summer program, every associate is evaluated on the same knowledge level and a final personal interview is conducted to select the students with the highest knowledge in the three domains. Other soft skills like communication are also kept in mind. Selected students are then assigned the position of sub-heads.\\n\\nStructure\\n\\nBusiness Club has a four-level organisational structure.\\n\\nAdvisors\\n consist of fourth and fifth-year members and are the senior-most members whose experience helps in guiding the overall direction of the club.\\n\\nThe executive body comprises of \\nGovernors\\n and \\nHeads\\n who are in the third year of their study. They are responsible for heading various wings of the club and its management.\\n\\nThe team of \\nSub-heads\\n is responsible for the day-to-day functioning of the club and the execution of its plans. It consists of students in the second year of their studies.\\n\\nAssociates\\n are the first years who have a passion to win and are generally business-oriented. These members are oriented towards gaining as much knowledge as they can from the pool of knowledge available to the seniors.\\n\\nThe functional structure of the Business Club consists of three wings – \\nfinance, analytics, and strategy\\n. These wings include all that happens within the world of business.\\n\\nActivities\\n\\nIntra-Club activities\\n\\nTo prepare the associates for the sub-head tenure, they are encouraged to participate in various activities to lay a strong foundation in the three domains of Analytics, Finance, and Strategy. These activities include: \\n\\nIntra-club case study Competition\\n - The associate batch is divided into small groups and each team is allotted a sub-head as a mentor, who guides the associate batch in solving the problem statement. On the D-day, the executive batch judges the teams through their presentations, and valuable inputs are given.\\n\\nKnowledge meets\\n - Organising knowledge meetings is the way by which knowledge dissipation happens in the Club. These meetings are conducted by Club members, where they meet and brainstorm on various topics of interest. A strong network consisting of resourceful seniors and mentor professors clarifies any doubts the members may have and make the meetings fruitful.\\n\\nWhitepaper -\\n This event is organized so that the associates could choose and research the topic of their choice in the domain of the three wings of the B-club. During the event, Associates put around 20 days of research and at the end present their papers in front of the executive and sub-head Batch, where they give useful insights into the topic\\n\\nDrafting modules and blogs -\\n \\xa0Club members design modules and blogs in the three wings. These modules are released through the public handle.\\n\\nSummer program\\n\\nDuring the Summer holidays, many first-years apart from the Associate Batch are selected for the program as Summer Associates. \\n\\nCase study competition\\n - This is the second intra-club case study competition. This time associates are made to solve the problem statement on their own without the mentorship of seniors, considering they have already done the courses in the three domains.\\n\\nAnalytics competition\\n - This competition concentrates on the core of machine learning. Associates are given a data set and this competition demands writing algorithms without using built-in libraries and maximizing the accuracy score on the given dataset.\\n\\nTrading Competition -\\n \\xa0During this competition Associates and Summer Associates create a mock trading account. This competition lasts for 10 days and associates carry out intraday trading based on the technical and fundamental analysis they have learned in the program.\\n\\nAt the end of the summer program, based on the performance and participation in the summer program, associates are selected to be the part of sub-head batch. \\n\\nEvents organized by the Club\\n\\nThe club conducts a wide range of activities such as open house sessions and case studies enabling students to develop their business acumen by applying their skills and finding solutions to real-world problem statements.\\n\\nIndian Case Challenge\\n\\nEver since its inception in 2012, the Indian Case Challenge provides the best platform for undergraduate and graduate students from all over India to compete against each other and prove their business and entrepreneurial mettle in a real-life business case scenario. Not only are the participants expected to have strong business skills and financial understanding, but also a feeling for entrepreneurship and a sense of realizing market opportunities. \\n\\nICC 2021, organized in association with Kshitij, was a huge success and received a whopping 3200+ unique registrations, including international participation.\\n\\nOpen House Sessions\\n\\nBusiness Club strives to impart basic knowledge regarding the various facets of business, in an attempt to make the students of IIT Kharagpur more equipped to thrive in the ever-evolving global industry. Open house sessions on basic finance, analytics, and strategy that are conducted in conjunction with organizations such as Alphabeta, ZS Associates, and IIMC Consulting Club have gone a long way towards this.\\n\\nWebinars\\n\\nInformative webinars, presided\\xa0by renowned speakers who excel in their respective business fields, are conducted by the club, to enrich the knowledge of the students even in online mode.\\n\\nGovernors and Heads\\n\\n2014-15\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nSarthak Badjatiya\\n\\nShramajit Gupta\\n\\nVirendra Singh\\n\\n Heads\\n\\nAnalytics: Pranay Yadav\\n\\nConsultancy: Pratyush Devliyal\\n\\nFinance: Umang Mavani\\n\\nTechnical: Ravikiran Shinde\\n\\n2015-16\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nAshutosh Dwivedi\\n\\nNishant Jayaswal\\n\\nShiladitya Saha\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Raunak Chitlangia, Shubhrit Agrawal\\n\\nConsultancy: Manik Aggarwal\\n\\nFinance: Dhruva Ratanpura\\n\\nTechnical: Murtaza Phalasiya, Rajat Bhavnani\\n\\nLogistics: Rihen Chheda, Ritwik Bajaj\\n\\n2016-17\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nPriya Mehta\\n\\nKumar Sparsh\\n\\nUdit Sarin\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Charu Agarwal, Shwetha Krishnamurthy\\n\\nFinance: Debjyoti Chakrabarti\\n\\nConsultancy: Medha Asija\\n\\nTechnical: Shubham Singhal, Vaibhav Chauhan\\n\\n2017-18\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nHarsh Agarwal\\n\\nHitendra Pratap\\n\\nShubhra Agrawal\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Ankit Agarwal, Subham Rajgaria\\n\\nFinance: Ankit Agarwal, Rajat Ragha, Shubham Sharma\\n\\nStrategy: Shubham Maheshwari\\n\\nBlogs and Articles: Rahul Raj\\n\\nDesign: Anjali Bharti\\n\\n2018-19\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nAman Sharma\\n\\nNikita Kishore\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Yash Jain\\n\\nFinance: Amandeep Singh, Puneet Pansari\\n\\nStrategy: Amit Gunjan, Yogshree Choukse\\n\\n2019-20\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nAditya Parashar\\n\\nDeepankar Sachdeva\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Amrit Goswami, Chinmay Singh, Karan Mahajan\\n\\nFinance: Shreyansh Jain, Vikrant Gupta\\n\\nStrategy: Tushar Mohandas, Tushar Singla\\n\\nTechnical: Aditya Singhania\\n\\n2020-21\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nAryan Saxena\\n\\nLakshraj Doshi\\n\\nShashank Singh\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Arusarka Bose, Naman Paharia, Abhinav Bohra\\n\\nFinance: Sayantan Das, Lakshiyata Chhajer, Amur Khandelwal\\n\\nStrategy: Shivam, Gaurav Joshi, Inakshi Kar\\n\\n2021-22\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nArya Uttamchandani\\n\\nSankalp Bose\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Karan Uppal, Dikshant Pratap Singh\\n\\nFinance: Arnav Bhutda, Suhas Jain, Aditya Saha\\n\\nStrategy: Tejaswi Pagadala, Kashish Lundia\\n\\nWeb: Piyush Dhamane\\n\\nBranding and Public Relations: Deepansh Agrawal\\n\\n2022-2023\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nMadiha Hanifa\\n\\nBharat Uday\\n\\n Heads\\n\\nAnalytics: Vaibhav Jalani\\n\\nStrategy: Siddharth Madupathi, Pragya Choudhary\\n\\nFinance: Ram Sundaram, Patel Yuti\\n\\nWeb and Design: Sai Kalyan Meghavath\\n\\n2023-2024\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nSiddharth Dikshit\\n\\nShreeya Mishra\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Adyan Rizvi, Ishan Ray, Lokesh Tirthani\\n\\nFinance: Suryaansh Jindal, Ojasvi R Singh\\n\\nStrategy: Atmajyoti Ghosh, Arya Vardhan Singh, Jash Mody\\n\\nAchievements\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Business_Club&oldid=227127\\n\"',\n",

Next morning, he had to re-visit the hospital because his conditions had gone worse and he was in severe pain. He was then sent back home with some prescribed painkillers. Unfortunately, while going back to his hostel he collapsed and his head hit a cow-trap. He was immediately taken back to the hospital where he waited around 3 hours to get an appointment with a doctor. After his arrival, the doctor without any treatment, referred him to Apollo Hospital, Kolkata stating that he needed a neurologist. He was put in an ambulance with two of his friends and one pharmacist and no trained paramedic. On the way, the conditions got worse and they decided to go for Midnapore Hospital instead. He was declared \\'Dead on Arrival\\' at Medinipur Hospital.\\n\\nThis incident lead to an outraged protest against the Director, IIT Kharagpur.

       " {'text': 'Content\\n\\nObjective of Course\\n: Our brain is the most sophisticated computational machine. It can change its own components and rewire itself into a new configuration as required for new function. Synapses, the connection between neurons, are the fundamental computational units of the brain and are the essential components needed for the brain’s remarkable ability to adapt itself. Defect in synaptic function are cause of most neuropsychiatric and learning disorders. Understanding the role of the synapse in neural computation is essential to figure out how our brain works in health and in disease conditions. In the course, students will be not only familiar about the synaptic function and plasticity including the latest tools used to explore the synaptic function but also will understand how synaptic dysfunction leads various psychiatric and learning disorders. \\n\\nCourse Content: 1) Neural doctrine. History and discovery of synapse and chemical transmission, Dales principle, Types of synapses and their mode of action. Post synaptic signalling mechanisms and their regulation. (4 hours)\\n\\n2) Synaptic plasticity: Techniques to study synaptic plasticity, mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, depression and facilitation, short term and long term plasticity, different plasticity rules, computational implications, spike timing dependent plasticity, learning and memory formation, self-organization. (5 hours)\\n\\n3) Synapse and critical period of development of various sensory function, enriched environment and experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. Synaptic dysfunction and psychiatric disorders, synaptic dysfunction and neurodevelopmental disorders. Autism, autism spectrum disorders like Down syndrome, Rett syndrome, Fragile-X syndrome, Angelman syndrome. Post traumatic stress disorders (6 hours)\\n\\n4) AMPA and NMDA receptors and their role in LTP and LTD. Short-term and long term memory, Techniques to study Hippocampal LTP. Glutamate excitotoxicity and its involvement in stroke and chronic neurodegenerative disorders. Various exogenous and endogenous neurotoxins working through NMDA, kinate or AMPA receptors, neurolathyrism. GABA receptor structure and physiological significance of its various regulatory sites (Barbiturates, Benzodiazepine binding etc.). (7 hours) \\n\\n5) Cause and possible pathogenic mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Cholinergic projections in the brain and dysfunction of cholinergic neurons in AD. Cause and pathogenesis of Huntington’s disease and Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis. (5 hours)\\n\\n6) Catecholaminergic (dopamine, serotonin, nor-epinephrine and histamine) projections and their physiological role in controlling mood and other behaviours. Stress, anxiety and depression, HPA axis, hippocampus and amygdala. Dopaminergic pathways and its involvement in Parkinson’s disease as well as Schizophrenia. Various other causes of Schizophrenia and Bipolar disorders. Stress and cognitive dysfunction. (7 hours) \\n\\n7) Synaptic mechanism of drug reward and addiction. Drug tolerance and withdrawal mechanisms. Cocaine, amphetamine, opiate and their mode of action. Opiate and Canabinoid receptors and their physiological significance. Neurobiological basis of placebo effect. (4 hours)\\n\\nOpinion\\n\\nTake this course if interested in Brain or biology. A lot of bio stuff is present in the course. Course is taught by two profs - NJ and SB. NJ part is chill, have to remember basics, to write the exam. SB part involves lot of open ended questions, can answer them only if concepts taught by SB in class are understood well.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=BS60003:_NEUROCHEMISTRY&oldid=193722\\n\"',\n",

It provides a platform for like-minded individuals who yearn to enrich their knowledge of business and apply their skills in various competitions like case studies and hackathons at the national and international levels. A family of around 70 student members, actively working under 3 wings: \\nStrategy, Finance, and Analytics\\n, BClub is constantly striving to bridge the gap between business and technology. \\n\\nContents\\n\\n1\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n1.1\\n\\nFounding\\n\\n1.2\\n\\nGrowth\\n\\n2\\n\\nFunctioning\\n\\n2.1\\n\\nSelections\\n\\n2.1.1\\n\\nFirst-year selections\\n\\n2.1.2\\n\\nSecond-year selections\\n\\n2.2\\n\\nStructure\\n\\n2.3\\n\\nActivities\\n\\n3\\n\\nGovernors and Heads\\n\\n3.1\\n\\n2014-15\\n\\n3.2\\n\\n2015-16\\n\\n3.3\\n\\n2016-17\\n\\n3.4\\n\\n2017-18\\n\\n3.5\\n\\n2018-19\\n\\n3.6\\n\\n2019-20\\n\\n3.7\\n\\n2021-22\\n\\n3.8\\n\\n2022-2023\\n\\n3.9\\n\\n2023-2024\\n\\n4\\n\\nAchievements\\n\\n5\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nFounding\\n\\nBusiness Club was founded in 2009 as \\nGenese-de-Strategie\\n by Shailesh Gupta, Harsh Gupta, Srichandana Sanjeev, Sudipto Sannigrahi, and Mayank Mundra. Genesie-de-Strategie was started with a primary objective to educate the students about the world of business strategies. The founders felt a need for students to be informed about the working of the business world for their growth. Over the course of a year, they realised the need to have a more wholesome approach to the world of business. They formed the Business Club in 2010 with a broader perspective toward business.\\n\\nGrowth\\n\\nIndian Case Challenge,\\n India’s largest case competition, is the flagship event of the Business Club. ICC now witnesses international participation as well.\\n\\nAffiliation to Technology Students’ Gymkhana\\n (during the academic session 2014-15) brought official recognition to the club.\\n\\nThe Business Club has started to reach out to the entire student population of the college by conducting \\nOpen House Sessions\\n for their benefit.\\n\\nRegular \\nsocial media content\\n and \\nblogs\\n in the domain of finance, strategy and analytics are uploaded on all major social media platforms to keep readers updated.\\n\\nFunctioning\\n\\nSelections\\n\\nSelections to the Business Club are held at the beginning of the first and the second academic year.\\n\\nFirst-year selections\\n\\nThe selection procedure consists of a \\ngroup-discussion\\n round followed by a personal \\ninterview\\n for the shortlisted candidates. Prospective members aren’t judged based on their business acumen, but on their ability to think clearly, present thoughts in a concise and structured manner, their dedication, and their zeal to learn.\\n\\nSecond-year selections\\n\\nA training period called the \\nsummer program\\n is conducted for the students selected in the second academic year to level their knowledge with the students selected in the first year. During this time, they are provided with the same resources to learn everything necessary. \\n\\nAfter the summer program, every associate is evaluated on the same knowledge level and a final personal interview is conducted to select the students with the highest knowledge in the three domains. Other soft skills like communication are also kept in mind. Selected students are then assigned the position of sub-heads.\\n\\nStructure\\n\\nBusiness Club has a four-level organisational structure.\\n\\nAdvisors\\n consist of fourth and fifth-year members and are the senior-most members whose experience helps in guiding the overall direction of the club.\\n\\nThe executive body comprises of \\nGovernors\\n and \\nHeads\\n who are in the third year of their study. They are responsible for heading various wings of the club and its management.\\n\\nThe team of \\nSub-heads\\n is responsible for the day-to-day functioning of the club and the execution of its plans. It consists of students in the second year of their studies.\\n\\nAssociates\\n are the first years who have a passion to win and are generally business-oriented. These members are oriented towards gaining as much knowledge as they can from the pool of knowledge available to the seniors.\\n\\nThe functional structure of the Business Club consists of three wings – \\nfinance, analytics, and strategy\\n. These wings include all that happens within the world of business.\\n\\nActivities\\n\\nIntra-Club activities\\n\\nTo prepare the associates for the sub-head tenure, they are encouraged to participate in various activities to lay a strong foundation in the three domains of Analytics, Finance, and Strategy. These activities include: \\n\\nIntra-club case study Competition\\n - The associate batch is divided into small groups and each team is allotted a sub-head as a mentor, who guides the associate batch in solving the problem statement. On the D-day, the executive batch judges the teams through their presentations, and valuable inputs are given.\\n\\nKnowledge meets\\n - Organising knowledge meetings is the way by which knowledge dissipation happens in the Club. These meetings are conducted by Club members, where they meet and brainstorm on various topics of interest. A strong network consisting of resourceful seniors and mentor professors clarifies any doubts the members may have and make the meetings fruitful.\\n\\nWhitepaper -\\n This event is organized so that the associates could choose and research the topic of their choice in the domain of the three wings of the B-club. During the event, Associates put around 20 days of research and at the end present their papers in front of the executive and sub-head Batch, where they give useful insights into the topic\\n\\nDrafting modules and blogs -\\n \\xa0Club members design modules and blogs in the three wings. These modules are released through the public handle.\\n\\nSummer program\\n\\nDuring the Summer holidays, many first-years apart from the Associate Batch are selected for the program as Summer Associates. \\n\\nCase study competition\\n - This is the second intra-club case study competition. This time associates are made to solve the problem statement on their own without the mentorship of seniors, considering they have already done the courses in the three domains.\\n\\nAnalytics competition\\n - This competition concentrates on the core of machine learning. Associates are given a data set and this competition demands writing algorithms without using built-in libraries and maximizing the accuracy score on the given dataset.\\n\\nTrading Competition -\\n \\xa0During this competition Associates and Summer Associates create a mock trading account. This competition lasts for 10 days and associates carry out intraday trading based on the technical and fundamental analysis they have learned in the program.\\n\\nAt the end of the summer program, based on the performance and participation in the summer program, associates are selected to be the part of sub-head batch. \\n\\nEvents organized by the Club\\n\\nThe club conducts a wide range of activities such as open house sessions and case studies enabling students to develop their business acumen by applying their skills and finding solutions to real-world problem statements.\\n\\nIndian Case Challenge\\n\\nEver since its inception in 2012, the Indian Case Challenge provides the best platform for undergraduate and graduate students from all over India to compete against each other and prove their business and entrepreneurial mettle in a real-life business case scenario. Not only are the participants expected to have strong business skills and financial understanding, but also a feeling for entrepreneurship and a sense of realizing market opportunities. \\n\\nICC 2021, organized in association with Kshitij, was a huge success and received a whopping 3200+ unique registrations, including international participation.\\n\\nOpen House Sessions\\n\\nBusiness Club strives to impart basic knowledge regarding the various facets of business, in an attempt to make the students of IIT Kharagpur more equipped to thrive in the ever-evolving global industry. Open house sessions on basic finance, analytics, and strategy that are conducted in conjunction with organizations such as Alphabeta, ZS Associates, and IIMC Consulting Club have gone a long way towards this.\\n\\nWebinars\\n\\nInformative webinars, presided\\xa0by renowned speakers who excel in their respective business fields, are conducted by the club, to enrich the knowledge of the students even in online mode.\\n\\nGovernors and Heads\\n\\n2014-15\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nSarthak Badjatiya\\n\\nShramajit Gupta\\n\\nVirendra Singh\\n\\n Heads\\n\\nAnalytics: Pranay Yadav\\n\\nConsultancy: Pratyush Devliyal\\n\\nFinance: Umang Mavani\\n\\nTechnical: Ravikiran Shinde\\n\\n2015-16\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nAshutosh Dwivedi\\n\\nNishant Jayaswal\\n\\nShiladitya Saha\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Raunak Chitlangia, Shubhrit Agrawal\\n\\nConsultancy: Manik Aggarwal\\n\\nFinance: Dhruva Ratanpura\\n\\nTechnical: Murtaza Phalasiya, Rajat Bhavnani\\n\\nLogistics: Rihen Chheda, Ritwik Bajaj\\n\\n2016-17\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nPriya Mehta\\n\\nKumar Sparsh\\n\\nUdit Sarin\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Charu Agarwal, Shwetha Krishnamurthy\\n\\nFinance: Debjyoti Chakrabarti\\n\\nConsultancy: Medha Asija\\n\\nTechnical: Shubham Singhal, Vaibhav Chauhan\\n\\n2017-18\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nHarsh Agarwal\\n\\nHitendra Pratap\\n\\nShubhra Agrawal\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Ankit Agarwal, Subham Rajgaria\\n\\nFinance: Ankit Agarwal, Rajat Ragha, Shubham Sharma\\n\\nStrategy: Shubham Maheshwari\\n\\nBlogs and Articles: Rahul Raj\\n\\nDesign: Anjali Bharti\\n\\n2018-19\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nAman Sharma\\n\\nNikita Kishore\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Yash Jain\\n\\nFinance: Amandeep Singh, Puneet Pansari\\n\\nStrategy: Amit Gunjan, Yogshree Choukse\\n\\n2019-20\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nAditya Parashar\\n\\nDeepankar Sachdeva\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Amrit Goswami, Chinmay Singh, Karan Mahajan\\n\\nFinance: Shreyansh Jain, Vikrant Gupta\\n\\nStrategy: Tushar Mohandas, Tushar Singla\\n\\nTechnical: Aditya Singhania\\n\\n2020-21\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nAryan Saxena\\n\\nLakshraj Doshi\\n\\nShashank Singh\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Arusarka Bose, Naman Paharia, Abhinav Bohra\\n\\nFinance: Sayantan Das, Lakshiyata Chhajer, Amur Khandelwal\\n\\nStrategy: Shivam, Gaurav Joshi, Inakshi Kar\\n\\n2021-22\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nArya Uttamchandani\\n\\nSankalp Bose\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Karan Uppal, Dikshant Pratap Singh\\n\\nFinance: Arnav Bhutda, Suhas Jain, Aditya Saha\\n\\nStrategy: Tejaswi Pagadala, Kashish Lundia\\n\\nWeb: Piyush Dhamane\\n\\nBranding and Public Relations: Deepansh Agrawal\\n\\n2022-2023\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nMadiha Hanifa\\n\\nBharat Uday\\n\\n Heads\\n\\nAnalytics: Vaibhav Jalani\\n\\nStrategy: Siddharth Madupathi, Pragya Choudhary\\n\\nFinance: Ram Sundaram, Patel Yuti\\n\\nWeb and Design: Sai Kalyan Meghavath\\n\\n2023-2024\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nSiddharth Dikshit\\n\\nShreeya Mishra\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Adyan Rizvi, Ishan Ray, Lokesh Tirthani\\n\\nFinance: Suryaansh Jindal, Ojasvi R Singh\\n\\nStrategy: Atmajyoti Ghosh, Arya Vardhan Singh, Jash Mody\\n\\nAchievements\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Business_Club&oldid=227127\\n\"',\n",

It provides a platform for like-minded individuals who yearn to enrich their knowledge of business and apply their skills in various competitions like case studies and hackathons at the national and international levels. A family of around 70 student members, actively working under 3 wings: \\nStrategy, Finance, and Analytics\\n, BClub is constantly striving to bridge the gap between business and technology. \\n\\nContents\\n\\n1\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n1.1\\n\\nFounding\\n\\n1.2\\n\\nGrowth\\n\\n2\\n\\nFunctioning\\n\\n2.1\\n\\nSelections\\n\\n2.1.1\\n\\nFirst-year selections\\n\\n2.1.2\\n\\nSecond-year selections\\n\\n2.2\\n\\nStructure\\n\\n2.3\\n\\nActivities\\n\\n3\\n\\nGovernors and Heads\\n\\n3.1\\n\\n2014-15\\n\\n3.2\\n\\n2015-16\\n\\n3.3\\n\\n2016-17\\n\\n3.4\\n\\n2017-18\\n\\n3.5\\n\\n2018-19\\n\\n3.6\\n\\n2019-20\\n\\n3.7\\n\\n2021-22\\n\\n3.8\\n\\n2022-2023\\n\\n3.9\\n\\n2023-2024\\n\\n4\\n\\nAchievements\\n\\n5\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nFounding\\n\\nBusiness Club was founded in 2009 as \\nGenese-de-Strategie\\n by Shailesh Gupta, Harsh Gupta, Srichandana Sanjeev, Sudipto Sannigrahi, and Mayank Mundra. Genesie-de-Strategie was started with a primary objective to educate the students about the world of business strategies. The founders felt a need for students to be informed about the working of the business world for their growth. Over the course of a year, they realised the need to have a more wholesome approach to the world of business. They formed the Business Club in 2010 with a broader perspective toward business.\\n\\nGrowth\\n\\nIndian Case Challenge,\\n India’s largest case competition, is the flagship event of the Business Club. ICC now witnesses international participation as well.\\n\\nAffiliation to Technology Students’ Gymkhana\\n (during the academic session 2014-15) brought official recognition to the club.\\n\\nThe Business Club has started to reach out to the entire student population of the college by conducting \\nOpen House Sessions\\n for their benefit.\\n\\nRegular \\nsocial media content\\n and \\nblogs\\n in the domain of finance, strategy and analytics are uploaded on all major social media platforms to keep readers updated.\\n\\nFunctioning\\n\\nSelections\\n\\nSelections to the Business Club are held at the beginning of the first and the second academic year.\\n\\nFirst-year selections\\n\\nThe selection procedure consists of a \\ngroup-discussion\\n round followed by a personal \\ninterview\\n for the shortlisted candidates. Prospective members aren’t judged based on their business acumen, but on their ability to think clearly, present thoughts in a concise and structured manner, their dedication, and their zeal to learn.\\n\\nSecond-year selections\\n\\nA training period called the \\nsummer program\\n is conducted for the students selected in the second academic year to level their knowledge with the students selected in the first year. During this time, they are provided with the same resources to learn everything necessary. \\n\\nAfter the summer program, every associate is evaluated on the same knowledge level and a final personal interview is conducted to select the students with the highest knowledge in the three domains. Other soft skills like communication are also kept in mind. Selected students are then assigned the position of sub-heads.\\n\\nStructure\\n\\nBusiness Club has a four-level organisational structure.\\n\\nAdvisors\\n consist of fourth and fifth-year members and are the senior-most members whose experience helps in guiding the overall direction of the club.\\n\\nThe executive body comprises of \\nGovernors\\n and \\nHeads\\n who are in the third year of their study. They are responsible for heading various wings of the club and its management.\\n\\nThe team of \\nSub-heads\\n is responsible for the day-to-day functioning of the club and the execution of its plans. It consists of students in the second year of their studies.\\n\\nAssociates\\n are the first years who have a passion to win and are generally business-oriented. These members are oriented towards gaining as much knowledge as they can from the pool of knowledge available to the seniors.\\n\\nThe functional structure of the Business Club consists of three wings – \\nfinance, analytics, and strategy\\n. These wings include all that happens within the world of business.\\n\\nActivities\\n\\nIntra-Club activities\\n\\nTo prepare the associates for the sub-head tenure, they are encouraged to participate in various activities to lay a strong foundation in the three domains of Analytics, Finance, and Strategy. These activities include: \\n\\nIntra-club case study Competition\\n - The associate batch is divided into small groups and each team is allotted a sub-head as a mentor, who guides the associate batch in solving the problem statement. On the D-day, the executive batch judges the teams through their presentations, and valuable inputs are given.\\n\\nKnowledge meets\\n - Organising knowledge meetings is the way by which knowledge dissipation happens in the Club. These meetings are conducted by Club members, where they meet and brainstorm on various topics of interest. A strong network consisting of resourceful seniors and mentor professors clarifies any doubts the members may have and make the meetings fruitful.\\n\\nWhitepaper -\\n This event is organized so that the associates could choose and research the topic of their choice in the domain of the three wings of the B-club. During the event, Associates put around 20 days of research and at the end present their papers in front of the executive and sub-head Batch, where they give useful insights into the topic\\n\\nDrafting modules and blogs -\\n \\xa0Club members design modules and blogs in the three wings. These modules are released through the public handle.\\n\\nSummer program\\n\\nDuring the Summer holidays, many first-years apart from the Associate Batch are selected for the program as Summer Associates. \\n\\nCase study competition\\n - This is the second intra-club case study competition. This time associates are made to solve the problem statement on their own without the mentorship of seniors, considering they have already done the courses in the three domains.\\n\\nAnalytics competition\\n - This competition concentrates on the core of machine learning. Associates are given a data set and this competition demands writing algorithms without using built-in libraries and maximizing the accuracy score on the given dataset.\\n\\nTrading Competition -\\n \\xa0During this competition Associates and Summer Associates create a mock trading account. This competition lasts for 10 days and associates carry out intraday trading based on the technical and fundamental analysis they have learned in the program.\\n\\nAt the end of the summer program, based on the performance and participation in the summer program, associates are selected to be the part of sub-head batch. \\n\\nEvents organized by the Club\\n\\nThe club conducts a wide range of activities such as open house sessions and case studies enabling students to develop their business acumen by applying their skills and finding solutions to real-world problem statements.\\n\\nIndian Case Challenge\\n\\nEver since its inception in 2012, the Indian Case Challenge provides the best platform for undergraduate and graduate students from all over India to compete against each other and prove their business and entrepreneurial mettle in a real-life business case scenario. Not only are the participants expected to have strong business skills and financial understanding, but also a feeling for entrepreneurship and a sense of realizing market opportunities. \\n\\nICC 2021, organized in association with Kshitij, was a huge success and received a whopping 3200+ unique registrations, including international participation.\\n\\nOpen House Sessions\\n\\nBusiness Club strives to impart basic knowledge regarding the various facets of business, in an attempt to make the students of IIT Kharagpur more equipped to thrive in the ever-evolving global industry. Open house sessions on basic finance, analytics, and strategy that are conducted in conjunction with organizations such as Alphabeta, ZS Associates, and IIMC Consulting Club have gone a long way towards this.\\n\\nWebinars\\n\\nInformative webinars, presided\\xa0by renowned speakers who excel in their respective business fields, are conducted by the club, to enrich the knowledge of the students even in online mode.\\n\\nGovernors and Heads\\n\\n2014-15\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nSarthak Badjatiya\\n\\nShramajit Gupta\\n\\nVirendra Singh\\n\\n Heads\\n\\nAnalytics: Pranay Yadav\\n\\nConsultancy: Pratyush Devliyal\\n\\nFinance: Umang Mavani\\n\\nTechnical: Ravikiran Shinde\\n\\n2015-16\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nAshutosh Dwivedi\\n\\nNishant Jayaswal\\n\\nShiladitya Saha\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Raunak Chitlangia, Shubhrit Agrawal\\n\\nConsultancy: Manik Aggarwal\\n\\nFinance: Dhruva Ratanpura\\n\\nTechnical: Murtaza Phalasiya, Rajat Bhavnani\\n\\nLogistics: Rihen Chheda, Ritwik Bajaj\\n\\n2016-17\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nPriya Mehta\\n\\nKumar Sparsh\\n\\nUdit Sarin\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Charu Agarwal, Shwetha Krishnamurthy\\n\\nFinance: Debjyoti Chakrabarti\\n\\nConsultancy: Medha Asija\\n\\nTechnical: Shubham Singhal, Vaibhav Chauhan\\n\\n2017-18\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nHarsh Agarwal\\n\\nHitendra Pratap\\n\\nShubhra Agrawal\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Ankit Agarwal, Subham Rajgaria\\n\\nFinance: Ankit Agarwal, Rajat Ragha, Shubham Sharma\\n\\nStrategy: Shubham Maheshwari\\n\\nBlogs and Articles: Rahul Raj\\n\\nDesign: Anjali Bharti\\n\\n2018-19\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nAman Sharma\\n\\nNikita Kishore\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Yash Jain\\n\\nFinance: Amandeep Singh, Puneet Pansari\\n\\nStrategy: Amit Gunjan, Yogshree Choukse\\n\\n2019-20\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nAditya Parashar\\n\\nDeepankar Sachdeva\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Amrit Goswami, Chinmay Singh, Karan Mahajan\\n\\nFinance: Shreyansh Jain, Vikrant Gupta\\n\\nStrategy: Tushar Mohandas, Tushar Singla\\n\\nTechnical: Aditya Singhania\\n\\n2020-21\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nAryan Saxena\\n\\nLakshraj Doshi\\n\\nShashank Singh\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Arusarka Bose, Naman Paharia, Abhinav Bohra\\n\\nFinance: Sayantan Das, Lakshiyata Chhajer, Amur Khandelwal\\n\\nStrategy: Shivam, Gaurav Joshi, Inakshi Kar\\n\\n2021-22\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nArya Uttamchandani\\n\\nSankalp Bose\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Karan Uppal, Dikshant Pratap Singh\\n\\nFinance: Arnav Bhutda, Suhas Jain, Aditya Saha\\n\\nStrategy: Tejaswi Pagadala, Kashish Lundia\\n\\nWeb: Piyush Dhamane\\n\\nBranding and Public Relations: Deepansh Agrawal\\n\\n2022-2023\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nMadiha Hanifa\\n\\nBharat Uday\\n\\n Heads\\n\\nAnalytics: Vaibhav Jalani\\n\\nStrategy: Siddharth Madupathi, Pragya Choudhary\\n\\nFinance: Ram Sundaram, Patel Yuti\\n\\nWeb and Design: Sai Kalyan Meghavath\\n\\n2023-2024\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nSiddharth Dikshit\\n\\nShreeya Mishra\\n\\nHeads\\n\\nAnalytics: Adyan Rizvi, Ishan Ray, Lokesh Tirthani\\n\\nFinance: Suryaansh Jindal, Ojasvi R Singh\\n\\nStrategy: Atmajyoti Ghosh, Arya Vardhan Singh, Jash Mody\\n\\nAchievements\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Business_Club&oldid=227127\\n\"',\n",

For the first ten years of its existence, CET remained primarily a Research Centre and concentrated mainly on technology and technology infrastructure development and also conducting research in the area of Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL).The Centre developed Virtual Classroom software, multiparty Video Conferencing tool, Virtual Laboratory in different disciplines, Video on Demand facility (VOD), electronic test item banking sofware and experimented with their use in the teaching-learning process, The country wide Electronically Networked Life-Long Learning (El Net-3L) project being a typical example. \\n\\nIn 2001, CET moved into its present 25000 sft fully air conditioned location in the high-tech Takshasila building in the Ramanujan Complex. It houses world class video course production, web course production, video on demand, video conference based teaching facilties and other laboratories.   \\n\\nFrom 2005, CET took up additional resposibilty of offering M.Tech and Ph.D programmes in both technology and education areas and became a full fledged Academic Centre of the Institute. Currently it offers a two year full time M.Tech programme in Media and Sound Engineering with a major emphasis on audio-video systems engineering and image and speech processing. Presently, there are 9 Ph.D scholars working in widely differing areas such as game based learning, speech and image processing, virtual laboratories.

What\\'s new is the restricted way of solving. There exists a particular way of solving every question as directed by the professor which has to be strictly maintained. Preparation is easy, but the final result depends more on the efficiency of your calculations and how quick you solve each question.

The first half of the course dealt largely with surface phenomena and the latter half with crystallization and models for quantifying them. The course is not very demanding in terms of time required to study, however some concepts in the latter half of the course requires a few iterations. \\n\\nPros: It is a good course if you are interested in population balance, surface phenomena etc, and most of the topics covered are readily available in the book suggested by the professor\\n\\nCons: Sometimes there is lack of structure in the course. \\n\\nHow to Crack the Paper\\n\\nClassroom resources\\n\\nAdditional Resources\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=CH60026:_Fundamentals_Of_Particle_Technology&oldid=88135\\n\"',\n",

Only the syntactical part will change. \\n\\nIf you haven\\'t, it is high time that you learn C programming in your vacations (Winter and Summer). The following channels may help you: \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWliApDc61w&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwLSqGsERZGXGkA5AfMhcknE\\n , \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS8ACsmFCpmSZQv44y56AviLUbvyriVYh\\n .\\n\\nThe course is high paced because it\\'s quite natural that a 2 year course is compressed into a 40 hour lecture series.\\n\\nHowever , the question paper is not that easy (even for experienced students because of certain nitty-gritties involved). So practise as much as you can. And there is a PDS Doubt Session orgainised by SWG IIT Kharagpur. Do attend them.\\n\\nHow to Crack the Paper\\n\\nClassroom resources\\n\\nThe following link will lead you to past and current year slides and other resources, exam-dates, grades etc.\\n\\nhttp://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/pds/\\n\\nAdditional Resources\\n\\nInstiinfo Repository\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=CS11001:_Programming_And_Data_Structure&oldid=146270\\n\"',\n",

Also, make sure that you have solved the tutorials multiple times before the exams.\\n\\nThe paper pattern generally (for the one offered in Autumn semester) has an equal weightage of easy, medium and difficult questions. The easy questions may be like asking definitions or to show the running of the basic algorithms taught in class (like insertion in RB-Tree or the Dynamic Programming approach for Matrix Chain Multiplication). The other two types mainly asks for designing algorithms, some may ask to write pseudo code as well.\\n\\nTo perform well make sure that one is able to solve the easy questions in the least time possible.\\n\\nAdditional Resources\\n\\nApart from the classroom notes provided by the respective professors, the student can go through these reference books:\\n\\nIntroduction to Algorithms 3rd-edition 2010 PDF \\n\\nAlgorithm Design \\n\\nTime Table\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=CS21003:_Algorithms_-_I&oldid=238356\\n\"',\n",

The project carries at least 1/3rd weightage and usually, there is a lab test on Java Programming based on the Java concepts taught (simple but lengthy lab test). Attendance carries marks.\\n\\nStudent Opinion\\n\\nHow to Crack the Paper\\n\\nIn the Java programming test, make sure to write comments in your code. You may go for an editor like VSCode which does the basic getter and setter commenting by itself. These comments carry 10-20% weightage of the class test. Make sure you are able to code basic java programming with speed, without referring to internet. Students are genrraly allwoed to access internet during the test. Make sure the UI is neatly designed, it carries a lot of weightage. Having more features, though simple is a big plus. Attend all the labs. Attendance carries marks about 20 percent.\\n\\nClassroom resources\\n\\nAdditional Resources\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=CS29006:_Software_Engineering_Laboratory&oldid=88143\\n\"',\n",

The option to take this course comes first in sixth semester for Computer Science students, of which most of them enroll (96+ in a batch of 110). The lab component consists of 2 individual assignments and 2 group assignments, which are a great learning experience where you create something of potential value. The exams are relatively easy to score and given the scores, the number of Ex\\'s and A\\'s are not few. The exams mostly require to write boolean equations or draw decision trees. No theoritical answers. \\nKaustubhhiware\\n (\\ntalk\\n)\\n\\nHow to Crack the Paper\\n\\nClassroom resources\\n\\nAdditional Resources\\n\\nClass Test - 1\\n\\nMid-Sem\\n\\nMid-Sem_solutions\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=CS43002:_Database_Management_Systems&oldid=199328\\n\"',\n",

      "{'text': 'Introduction\\n\\n180 Degrees Consulting is the world’s largest organisation for non-profits and social enterprises with operations in more than 35 countries. The IIT Kharagpur branch of 180 Degrees Consulting (abbreviated as 180DC) was founded in April 2020 by Amritash Bharadwaj, Nikita Kishore, Adarsh Gupta, Aniket Shah and Keshav Godala with an aim to provide quality consultancy services to socially conscious corporations and NGOs to help them achieve the impact they seek to create.\\n\\nBeing students of the oldest, largest and most versatile of IITs, the team consists of driven and capable people with diverse skill sets across various fields. It is a platform where students can gain leadership skills, consulting experience and professional etiquette with a chance to derive value through the quality of their collaborative work.\\n\\nFunctioning\\n\\nSelections\\n\\nSelection procedures for 180DC are held at the start of the autumn semester. New recruits are taken in from second year only. The selection procedure consists of multiple rounds of interviews and discussions wherein prospective members aren’t judged on their knowledge of consultancy frameworks, but rather their problem-solving approach and whether they are able to present their thoughts in a structured manner.\\xa0  \\n\\nThe selection procedure evaluates the candidates on \\nStructured Thinking, Problem Solving, Work Ethic, Time Management,\\xa0Speaking, Writing and Design skills\\n. Good knowledge of business and finance is appreciated but is not the main factor of evaluation. We expect an optimal amount of time and dedication. \\n\\nKnowledge Meetings\\n\\nThe main opportunity to learn in 180 Degrees Consulting is via knowledge meetings. Seniors organise knowledge meetings to polish the skills of new recruits and also teach them various consulting techniques and frameworks. These knowledge meetings also involve case study competitions/workshops.\\n\\nOrganisational Structure\\n\\nAdvisors\\n consist of fourth and fifth-year members and are the senior-most members whose experience helps in guiding the overall direction of the organisation.\\n\\nDirectors\\n are members who are in their third and fourth year of study. They are responsible for heading various different portfolios and projects within the organisation.\\n\\nSenior Consultants\\n are the members who are in their second and third year of study. They are responsible for executing the portfolio and project work assigned by the Directors.\\n\\nConsultants\\n comprises the students who are in the second year.

      "{'text': 'On March 7th 2014, during MT Hall day students damaged furniture, threw them from the top floor and made graffiti on the walls. In some rooms fans were also bent. The event was widely condemned by authority and student community.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1\\n\\nDetails\\n\\n1.1\\n\\nTimeline\\n\\n1.2\\n\\nA list of things that happened\\n\\n2\\n\\nAftermath\\n\\n2.1\\n\\nAdministration\\n\\n2.2\\n\\nEmails sent by the VP TSG\\n\\n2.3\\n\\nMeetings between the student community and the VP TSG\\n\\n2.3.1\\n\\nFirst meeting\\n\\n2.3.2\\n\\nSecond meeting\\n\\n3\\n\\nConsequence\\n\\n4\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n5\\n\\nSee Also\\n\\n6\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nDetails\\n\\nImages:\\n\\nBent Fan\\n\\nThings thrown from top floor\\n\\nVandalized bed\\n\\nThe hall day proceedings started at about 7 pm as usual. This was the first hall day for the UG 1st year students (who joined the institute in July 2013). A soft rule was put in place requiring girls who had invited their male friends to come to the door and escort them inside. This rule was not enforced very rigidly. Security at the gates of the hall checked the ID Card of every student who was going into the hall.\\n\\nAfter entering the hall, students were milling around for about an hour or so, understanding the geography of the hall presumably and taking it all in, because this was the \\nonly day\\n that they were going to be allowed inside the hall for the next 1 year. This was also the first time that they had a taste of the hall day culture. Much had been made of this tradition by most seniors from societies that about 1/4th of the UG 1st year batch were part of.\\n\\nAround 8:15 PM, trouble started when some unruly activities started on the top floor where some first year female students lived. Boys were being pushed out of the room and boxes of surf, tubes of toothpaste were being dumped and squeezed onto their clothes. Presumably, the girls residing in these rooms did not say anything to stop this distressing behavior (perhaps even vocally supporting it) and allowed the act to continue. Quickly, things escalated to a point where mattresses and pillows were being thrown from the second and first floors onto the garden on the ground floor which had been fixed for the Hall Day. Even until this point, this was nothing more than a joke. This is where the tone of things changed into a competition.\\n\\nMembers of various societies started forming human chains and singing songs and marching around the floors and the stair cases. These chains had both male and female members and they were going from a room of one of their members to another one of their members. Allegedly, all the members were from first year, and although seniors were residing in this part of the hall, they did not intervene.\\n\\nSome seniors from 3rd and 4th years were seen walking around the in the ground in the center of the hall where the mattresses were being thrown and trying to convince people vocally to stop throwing things and behaving in an unruly manner. This call to regain control and stop the events went mostly unheeded.\\n\\nThe whole destruction went on for about an hour unchecked, due to some gross mishandling by the MT Hall President, VP TSG and the hall security guards, who were present on the premises for the whole evening but did not act.\\n\\nAt 9:15 pm - 9:30 pm, the hall day was brought to an end (approximately 30 minutes before the scheduled end), and everyone was asked to leave. All the men were herded around and summarily expelled from the hall. The mood among most students was celebratory. It is safe to assume that the destruction that they had done and the consequences of the same had not yet sunk in. After the hall-day, discussion regarding what happened was mostly done with a fair bit of humor and the event was filed away in memory for nearly 2 weeks. Some girls whose rooms were trashed talked about how it was unfair for their LAN ports to be broken and their only fault being that they had invited their friends into their rooms.\\n\\nTimeline\\n\\nA list of things that happened\\n\\nFans bent out of shape (see image)\\n\\nBeds thrown from as high up as the third floor onto the ground floor\\n\\nLAN ports broken\\n\\nObscene phrases on the walls of some rooms (references to the male and female reproductive organs using slang terms in English and Hindi)\\n\\nAftermath\\n\\nAdministration\\n\\nAt the time of this event, the following were the people who held different important positions.\\n\\nEmails sent by the VP TSG\\n\\nThe Vice President (TSG) at the time of the incident was Apoorv Jain. On 9th March, 2014, he sent an email to all students enclosing images of the destruction caused. He severely condemned this event. The attached images immediately found their way to Facebook, and subsequently to Quora where several questions asking \"why\" these events had happened at a prestigious institute such as IIT Kharagpur. As most first year students were dazed by the destruction they had enabled and participated in, no one had thought or been allowed to take pictures before being expelled from MT Hall. Pictures that did exist had not been widely circulated or posted on Facebook. So, in essence, if the VP TSG had decided not to include pictures of the destruction in his email, there would have been none in public circulation for anyone to look at.\\n\\nDear Students,\\n\\nThis letter is in regards to the recent occurrence of damage to institute property on 7th March, 2014 during Mother Teresa Hall Day. In a span of fifteen minutes, furniture in the rooms of several first year undergraduate students was either broken, damaged beyond repair or thrown from the top floors. Furthermore, the walls were defaced with obscene graffiti. The fact that few students indulged in such act of vandalism reflects poorly on the entire student community of IIT Kharagpur.\\n\\nThis heinous act of mass wreckage showed lack of respect for institute property and, more importantly, lack of character and morals in the offenders, and has left the student community of IIT Kharagpur equivalent of street ragamuffins. This kind of crude behaviour as shown in pictures attached is not expected of students of the forerunner of the IITs. IIT Kharagpur is not a mere academic institution, we boast of a rich fraternal culture, which is developed through a deep sense of gratitude towards the institute. Sadly, incident like this have raised a question on whether our freedom is compromising our civility and whether we deserve such infrastructural facilities.\\n\\nWe, the Office bearers of Technology Students\\' Gymkhana and all Hall Presidents are extremely disturbed by this irresponsible and dishonourable behaviour of our own students. Visibly, students have failed to capture the real essence of Hall Days. We hope students understand the gravity of the situation and refrain from such undignified activities in future.\\n\\nThank you\\nWith Regards\\nApoorv Jain\\nVP,TSG\\n\\nOn 19th March, 2014, at around 8 am, he sent this email to all the UG 1st year students.\\n\\nDear Students,\\n\\nToday, Prof N R Mandal (Dean, SA) will address all the UG 1st year students regarding MT Hall Day incident. So, all the students are kindly requested to be present in Netaji Auditorium at 6.30 pm.\\n\\nThank you\\n\\nWith Regards\\n\\nApoorv Jain\\nVP,TSG\\n\\nMeetings between the student community and the VP TSG\\n\\nFirst meeting\\n\\nOn 19th March, 2014, the whole UG 1st year batch (students who joined in 2013) was called for a meeting at Netaji Auditorium at 6:30 pm. Apoorv Jain sent out this email at around 8 am that morning.\\n\\nThis meeting was attended by then Dean (Student Affairs) Prof N R Mandal, then President TSG Prof. Joy Sen, VP TSG Apoorv Jain and a few hall presidents. The turn out at the 6:30 pm meeting was very less. (approximately 50-70 people out of a total UG 1st year batch of 1400 people)\\n\\nThe meeting was delayed and students who were present there were intimidated into manually calling their friends to the venue, this marginally increased the turn out. The intimidation was done by the VP TSG who was present there, along with some fourth year hall presidents who were visibly angry and disappointed with the turnout. Absurd threats were made against the few obedient students who had turned up. Eg: \\nAgar tumhara pura batch yahan nahi aayega, to yahan pe jitne bhi log hain, tum sab pe DC baithegi. Phir udhar jaake jawaab de dena.\\n (If your whole batch doesn\\'t get here, all of you who are present here will be acted upon by the Disciplinary Committee. You can then explain your situation there.)\\n\\nAround 7:30 pm, the professors arrived at \\nNetaji Auditorium\\n. A long address followed. Students present at this meeting were informed that the 12 day delay was because of then DOSA Prof. N R Mandal being out of station and thus being unable to act on the events. This delay was not to be misinterpreted as an unwillingness to act. Allusions were also made to the VP, President and other professors of the institute getting phone calls from alumni regarding the MT Hall Day incident. One of the things that stood out at this meeting, which was discussed for several weeks after this meeting, was Prof. Joy Sen\\'s famous reference to the 1979 Mel Gibson classic \\nMad Max\\n. He particularly pointed out the end of the 1979 movie where Mel Gibson\\'s character Max loses control over himself, after losing his family, and kills several members of the gang that was involved in the death of his wife and his infant son. Prof. Sen\\'s was trying to draw an analogy between the behavior of a few out of control freshman and the protagonist in a movie who does something explicable, but rather bizarre. While most people at this first meeting had not seen the movie Prof. Sen was talking about, it was clear to almost everyone present that he was grappling with what had happened and trying to make sense of it using the appreciated principle of \"life imitating art\"\\n\\nStudents present there were also informed by the VP TSG that there was widespread disappointment in the behavior of the UG 1st year students, and that since the General Championships had been suspended right after the incident on 7th March, there was considerable anger among students in senior batches.\\n\\nAll professors present at the meeting were irritated with the low turnout and left about 1 hour after the meeting started in an agitated state. Apoorv Jain then decided to convene a complete UG 1st year batch meeting at 9 pm that night. There was widespread panic about what the consequences would be. There were several threats (such as mass Disciplinary Committee action, barring from placement, etc) which were indirectly made by the VP TSG and other hall presidents present at the meeting. The ultimatum was to get the whole batch at Netaji Auditorium at 9 pm and then, the discussion would be about the possible recourse that could be taken to mitigate the event\\'s fall out.\\n\\nSecond meeting\\n\\nThe second meeting began at 9 pm and saw much higher turnout, with almost the whole UG 1st year batch turning up. People were found in MMM and LBS Halls of residences literally running around calling their friends and everyone in 1st year to this meeting. There was widespread panic regarding the threats that had been made. Notably, none of the professors came to this meeting. The meeting was attended by the hall presidents of Patel, Nehru, MT, SN/IG, apart from then VP TSG. This was viewed as a scare tactic, as some of the hall presidents referred to the absence of Orientation Procedure / OP for first years was somehow responsible for this behavior. Their direct implication was that people were running around wild because they had not been \"trained in the ways of KGP\". Referring to the suspension of the GCs as a result of the main incident, one of the Hall Presidents said, \\nTum logon ko pata nahi hain ki iska kya matlab hain, sab log bahut gusse mein hain. Agle sal jab tum log senior hall jaoge to tumhe pata chalega\\n (You don\\'t know about the importance of the GCs being suspended, everyone is angry about this. You all will face the consequences for this next year, when you go to senior halls)\\n\\nSome of the options discussed in this meeting included a reduced community service for the whole UG 1st year batch, so as to save a few people from getting a lot of the punishment. When the students present in the auditorium were asked, \\nAre you all willing to take the blame and stay back and do community service for the summer, so that not just a few of your friends face really bad consequences?\\n, a few students immediately shot down the idea. The general consensus among students who had not attended the hall day, had not witnessed the incident, and/or were completely not involved in the incident was that they should not have to pay with their time for the mistakes of a few groups of people. \\n\\nThe VP TSG made an effort to try to get traction for the shared punishment idea. He asked if anyone would like to defend it and try to convince their batch mates. Understandably, students who had been spotted by many people as being the main players in the destruction were in total support of this idea of shared blame to reduce the punishment. They were seen visibly confused and voiced their concerns with one student standing up and addressing the rest of the auditorium: \\nDekh lo yaar, sab log lenge blame toh sirf ek mahina rehna padega, nahi toh pata nahi kya hoga.\\n (If everyone takes the blame, the punishment will be very less and everyone would have to stay back only for 1 month. If not, we don\\'t know what the punishment might be)\\n\\nTensions were even higher than at the previous meeting because for the first time Apoorv Jain said that one of the common punishments doled out after disciplinary committee hearings were \"semester backlogs\\n which implied that a student will be disbarred from registering for one semester and hence would be unable to complete their course on time. Apart from this, this would also be in the official record of the student including the final grade transcript.\\n\\nConsequence\\n\\nA group of 27 1st year students were told to undergo community service for 2 months during the summer months of May and June 2014. There was no other official record made anywhere regarding this event.\\n[\\nunverified\\n]\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThe events of MT Hall Day 2014 were a classic case of the Bandwagon effect. The destruction was started by a small subset of people attending the Hall Day. It started as a joke, and eventually turned into a competition between the various societies on campus.\\n\\nInterestingly, some of the women who resided in the hall, who were acting as hosts in the hall day decided to preclude the possibility of destruction by locking themselves inside their rooms and not letting anyone in. Some of the male friends of these women who had locked their doors to outsiders then tried to fish them out of there by filling buckets with water and then throwing them into the room using the slit under the door. It must be noted that a similar method is used to lure cockroaches out of hiding spots in kitchen drains, that must definitely have been the source of this particular strategy.\\n\\nWhile some other women decided to give in, and some even participated in the destruction of their friend\\'s rooms. Claims can also be made about this being a direct application of the herd behaviour in real life. There have been \\nseveral\\n riots in the past that have been attributed to this particular characteristic of human behaviour.\\n\\nOn a brighter side, there were people who were trying to stop this from happening. Shushman Choudhury (CS, \\'15) was on the ground floor and was trying to stop people from throwing down mattresses by shouting at them. He gave up after about 15 minutes of this (it was rather dangerous to stand on the ground floor where the possibility of a mattress hitting you is non-significant), but it must be said that it must have taken considerable courage to even try to do something like this against a mob, that for all practical purposes, had lost all control on themselves and had stopped computing the turn of events, the consequences of the same and the state of the hall as it stood around them.\\n\\nLess attention is paid to the aftermath and the administration\\'s response to this event. The administration decided to witch-hunt a small group of people and decided to get a list of names and proceed with punishing them. They decided to talk to the women whose rooms were trashed in an attempt to get the names of their male friends who did the trashing out of them. This strategy didn\\'t work out well at first. Most women flat out refused to talk. Soon, the administration started using the only chip they had: threatening the woman with disciplinary proceedings for not cooperating. Soon enough, it was clear to all the women that this was not going away and that they had to come up with names or get ready to face the heat of saving their friends.\\n\\nGiven a choice, several women chose to name a few friends who they thought would be wildly off the administration\\'s radar and it would be very hard to actually punish them because it would be obvious to everyone that these people were not responsible, but the administration didn\\'t care about this and went ahead and prepared the list of 40-50 people who were going to do the community service in the summer. This list had a few people who had been included because only the first name had been provided by the women and there were several people with that name in the UG batch. One such person got his father to fly out to Kharagpur and talk to the director directly about what was going on and why this kind of mob justice was being handed out. His name was removed from the list subsequently.\\n\\nThe names of some other people were also included in this list although their connection to the events was non-existent. People who had been at home during the weekend of the events or who had been in the hall for a very short period of time were on this list. Some people were able to get their names off the list.\\n\\nThe administration\\'s tactics were simple: they set about intimidating 18 year olds into tattling on their friends. While many might imagine that in the same situation, they would have behaved in an honorable manner, one is forced to imagine what the conditions must have been like if nearly 50 names could be squeezed out of a population of highly un-cooperative women.\\n\\nSee Also\\n\\nHall Day\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n↑\\n\\n\"Open Letter of Condemnation | MT Hall day\"\\n - VP TSG 2013-2014 Apoorv Jain\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=2014-03-07_MT_Hall_Day_Incident&oldid=97174\\n\"', 'metadata': {'title': '2014-03-07 MT Hall Day Incident', 'url': 'https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/2014-03-07_MT_Hall_Day_Incident', 'timestamp': '2025-02-04 11:23:18', 'source_type': 'wiki_entry'}}\n",

New recruits are taken in from second year only. The selection procedure consists of multiple rounds of interviews and discussions wherein prospective members aren’t judged on their knowledge of consultancy frameworks, but rather their problem-solving approach and whether they are able to present their thoughts in a structured manner.\\xa0  \\n\\nThe selection procedure evaluates the candidates on \\nStructured Thinking, Problem Solving, Work Ethic, Time Management,\\xa0Speaking, Writing and Design skills\\n. Good knowledge of business and finance is appreciated but is not the main factor of evaluation. We expect an optimal amount of time and dedication. \\n\\nKnowledge Meetings\\n\\nThe main opportunity to learn in 180 Degrees Consulting is via knowledge meetings. Seniors organise knowledge meetings to polish the skills of new recruits and also teach them various consulting techniques and frameworks. These knowledge meetings also involve case study competitions/workshops.\\n\\nOrganisational Structure\\n\\nAdvisors\\n consist of fourth and fifth-year members and are the senior-most members whose experience helps in guiding the overall direction of the organisation.\\n\\nDirectors\\n are members who are in their third and fourth year of study.

      "{'text': 'On March 7th 2014, during MT Hall day students damaged furniture, threw them from the top floor and made graffiti on the walls. In some rooms fans were also bent. The event was widely condemned by authority and student community.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1\\n\\nDetails\\n\\n1.1\\n\\nTimeline\\n\\n1.2\\n\\nA list of things that happened\\n\\n2\\n\\nAftermath\\n\\n2.1\\n\\nAdministration\\n\\n2.2\\n\\nEmails sent by the VP TSG\\n\\n2.3\\n\\nMeetings between the student community and the VP TSG\\n\\n2.3.1\\n\\nFirst meeting\\n\\n2.3.2\\n\\nSecond meeting\\n\\n3\\n\\nConsequence\\n\\n4\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n5\\n\\nSee Also\\n\\n6\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nDetails\\n\\nImages:\\n\\nBent Fan\\n\\nThings thrown from top floor\\n\\nVandalized bed\\n\\nThe hall day proceedings started at about 7 pm as usual. This was the first hall day for the UG 1st year students (who joined the institute in July 2013). A soft rule was put in place requiring girls who had invited their male friends to come to the door and escort them inside. This rule was not enforced very rigidly. Security at the gates of the hall checked the ID Card of every student who was going into the hall.\\n\\nAfter entering the hall, students were milling around for about an hour or so, understanding the geography of the hall presumably and taking it all in, because this was the \\nonly day\\n that they were going to be allowed inside the hall for the next 1 year. This was also the first time that they had a taste of the hall day culture. Much had been made of this tradition by most seniors from societies that about 1/4th of the UG 1st year batch were part of.\\n\\nAround 8:15 PM, trouble started when some unruly activities started on the top floor where some first year female students lived. Boys were being pushed out of the room and boxes of surf, tubes of toothpaste were being dumped and squeezed onto their clothes. Presumably, the girls residing in these rooms did not say anything to stop this distressing behavior (perhaps even vocally supporting it) and allowed the act to continue. Quickly, things escalated to a point where mattresses and pillows were being thrown from the second and first floors onto the garden on the ground floor which had been fixed for the Hall Day. Even until this point, this was nothing more than a joke. This is where the tone of things changed into a competition.\\n\\nMembers of various societies started forming human chains and singing songs and marching around the floors and the stair cases. These chains had both male and female members and they were going from a room of one of their members to another one of their members. Allegedly, all the members were from first year, and although seniors were residing in this part of the hall, they did not intervene.\\n\\nSome seniors from 3rd and 4th years were seen walking around the in the ground in the center of the hall where the mattresses were being thrown and trying to convince people vocally to stop throwing things and behaving in an unruly manner. This call to regain control and stop the events went mostly unheeded.\\n\\nThe whole destruction went on for about an hour unchecked, due to some gross mishandling by the MT Hall President, VP TSG and the hall security guards, who were present on the premises for the whole evening but did not act.\\n\\nAt 9:15 pm - 9:30 pm, the hall day was brought to an end (approximately 30 minutes before the scheduled end), and everyone was asked to leave. All the men were herded around and summarily expelled from the hall. The mood among most students was celebratory. It is safe to assume that the destruction that they had done and the consequences of the same had not yet sunk in. After the hall-day, discussion regarding what happened was mostly done with a fair bit of humor and the event was filed away in memory for nearly 2 weeks. Some girls whose rooms were trashed talked about how it was unfair for their LAN ports to be broken and their only fault being that they had invited their friends into their rooms.\\n\\nTimeline\\n\\nA list of things that happened\\n\\nFans bent out of shape (see image)\\n\\nBeds thrown from as high up as the third floor onto the ground floor\\n\\nLAN ports broken\\n\\nObscene phrases on the walls of some rooms (references to the male and female reproductive organs using slang terms in English and Hindi)\\n\\nAftermath\\n\\nAdministration\\n\\nAt the time of this event, the following were the people who held different important positions.\\n\\nEmails sent by the VP TSG\\n\\nThe Vice President (TSG) at the time of the incident was Apoorv Jain. On 9th March, 2014, he sent an email to all students enclosing images of the destruction caused. He severely condemned this event. The attached images immediately found their way to Facebook, and subsequently to Quora where several questions asking \"why\" these events had happened at a prestigious institute such as IIT Kharagpur. As most first year students were dazed by the destruction they had enabled and participated in, no one had thought or been allowed to take pictures before being expelled from MT Hall. Pictures that did exist had not been widely circulated or posted on Facebook. So, in essence, if the VP TSG had decided not to include pictures of the destruction in his email, there would have been none in public circulation for anyone to look at.\\n\\nDear Students,\\n\\nThis letter is in regards to the recent occurrence of damage to institute property on 7th March, 2014 during Mother Teresa Hall Day. In a span of fifteen minutes, furniture in the rooms of several first year undergraduate students was either broken, damaged beyond repair or thrown from the top floors. Furthermore, the walls were defaced with obscene graffiti. The fact that few students indulged in such act of vandalism reflects poorly on the entire student community of IIT Kharagpur.\\n\\nThis heinous act of mass wreckage showed lack of respect for institute property and, more importantly, lack of character and morals in the offenders, and has left the student community of IIT Kharagpur equivalent of street ragamuffins. This kind of crude behaviour as shown in pictures attached is not expected of students of the forerunner of the IITs. IIT Kharagpur is not a mere academic institution, we boast of a rich fraternal culture, which is developed through a deep sense of gratitude towards the institute. Sadly, incident like this have raised a question on whether our freedom is compromising our civility and whether we deserve such infrastructural facilities.\\n\\nWe, the Office bearers of Technology Students\\' Gymkhana and all Hall Presidents are extremely disturbed by this irresponsible and dishonourable behaviour of our own students. Visibly, students have failed to capture the real essence of Hall Days. We hope students understand the gravity of the situation and refrain from such undignified activities in future.\\n\\nThank you\\nWith Regards\\nApoorv Jain\\nVP,TSG\\n\\nOn 19th March, 2014, at around 8 am, he sent this email to all the UG 1st year students.\\n\\nDear Students,\\n\\nToday, Prof N R Mandal (Dean, SA) will address all the UG 1st year students regarding MT Hall Day incident. So, all the students are kindly requested to be present in Netaji Auditorium at 6.30 pm.\\n\\nThank you\\n\\nWith Regards\\n\\nApoorv Jain\\nVP,TSG\\n\\nMeetings between the student community and the VP TSG\\n\\nFirst meeting\\n\\nOn 19th March, 2014, the whole UG 1st year batch (students who joined in 2013) was called for a meeting at Netaji Auditorium at 6:30 pm. Apoorv Jain sent out this email at around 8 am that morning.\\n\\nThis meeting was attended by then Dean (Student Affairs) Prof N R Mandal, then President TSG Prof. Joy Sen, VP TSG Apoorv Jain and a few hall presidents. The turn out at the 6:30 pm meeting was very less. (approximately 50-70 people out of a total UG 1st year batch of 1400 people)\\n\\nThe meeting was delayed and students who were present there were intimidated into manually calling their friends to the venue, this marginally increased the turn out. The intimidation was done by the VP TSG who was present there, along with some fourth year hall presidents who were visibly angry and disappointed with the turnout. Absurd threats were made against the few obedient students who had turned up. Eg: \\nAgar tumhara pura batch yahan nahi aayega, to yahan pe jitne bhi log hain, tum sab pe DC baithegi. Phir udhar jaake jawaab de dena.\\n (If your whole batch doesn\\'t get here, all of you who are present here will be acted upon by the Disciplinary Committee. You can then explain your situation there.)\\n\\nAround 7:30 pm, the professors arrived at \\nNetaji Auditorium\\n. A long address followed. Students present at this meeting were informed that the 12 day delay was because of then DOSA Prof. N R Mandal being out of station and thus being unable to act on the events. This delay was not to be misinterpreted as an unwillingness to act. Allusions were also made to the VP, President and other professors of the institute getting phone calls from alumni regarding the MT Hall Day incident. One of the things that stood out at this meeting, which was discussed for several weeks after this meeting, was Prof. Joy Sen\\'s famous reference to the 1979 Mel Gibson classic \\nMad Max\\n. He particularly pointed out the end of the 1979 movie where Mel Gibson\\'s character Max loses control over himself, after losing his family, and kills several members of the gang that was involved in the death of his wife and his infant son. Prof. Sen\\'s was trying to draw an analogy between the behavior of a few out of control freshman and the protagonist in a movie who does something explicable, but rather bizarre. While most people at this first meeting had not seen the movie Prof. Sen was talking about, it was clear to almost everyone present that he was grappling with what had happened and trying to make sense of it using the appreciated principle of \"life imitating art\"\\n\\nStudents present there were also informed by the VP TSG that there was widespread disappointment in the behavior of the UG 1st year students, and that since the General Championships had been suspended right after the incident on 7th March, there was considerable anger among students in senior batches.\\n\\nAll professors present at the meeting were irritated with the low turnout and left about 1 hour after the meeting started in an agitated state. Apoorv Jain then decided to convene a complete UG 1st year batch meeting at 9 pm that night. There was widespread panic about what the consequences would be. There were several threats (such as mass Disciplinary Committee action, barring from placement, etc) which were indirectly made by the VP TSG and other hall presidents present at the meeting. The ultimatum was to get the whole batch at Netaji Auditorium at 9 pm and then, the discussion would be about the possible recourse that could be taken to mitigate the event\\'s fall out.\\n\\nSecond meeting\\n\\nThe second meeting began at 9 pm and saw much higher turnout, with almost the whole UG 1st year batch turning up. People were found in MMM and LBS Halls of residences literally running around calling their friends and everyone in 1st year to this meeting. There was widespread panic regarding the threats that had been made. Notably, none of the professors came to this meeting. The meeting was attended by the hall presidents of Patel, Nehru, MT, SN/IG, apart from then VP TSG. This was viewed as a scare tactic, as some of the hall presidents referred to the absence of Orientation Procedure / OP for first years was somehow responsible for this behavior. Their direct implication was that people were running around wild because they had not been \"trained in the ways of KGP\". Referring to the suspension of the GCs as a result of the main incident, one of the Hall Presidents said, \\nTum logon ko pata nahi hain ki iska kya matlab hain, sab log bahut gusse mein hain. Agle sal jab tum log senior hall jaoge to tumhe pata chalega\\n (You don\\'t know about the importance of the GCs being suspended, everyone is angry about this. You all will face the consequences for this next year, when you go to senior halls)\\n\\nSome of the options discussed in this meeting included a reduced community service for the whole UG 1st year batch, so as to save a few people from getting a lot of the punishment. When the students present in the auditorium were asked, \\nAre you all willing to take the blame and stay back and do community service for the summer, so that not just a few of your friends face really bad consequences?\\n, a few students immediately shot down the idea. The general consensus among students who had not attended the hall day, had not witnessed the incident, and/or were completely not involved in the incident was that they should not have to pay with their time for the mistakes of a few groups of people. \\n\\nThe VP TSG made an effort to try to get traction for the shared punishment idea. He asked if anyone would like to defend it and try to convince their batch mates. Understandably, students who had been spotted by many people as being the main players in the destruction were in total support of this idea of shared blame to reduce the punishment. They were seen visibly confused and voiced their concerns with one student standing up and addressing the rest of the auditorium: \\nDekh lo yaar, sab log lenge blame toh sirf ek mahina rehna padega, nahi toh pata nahi kya hoga.\\n (If everyone takes the blame, the punishment will be very less and everyone would have to stay back only for 1 month. If not, we don\\'t know what the punishment might be)\\n\\nTensions were even higher than at the previous meeting because for the first time Apoorv Jain said that one of the common punishments doled out after disciplinary committee hearings were \"semester backlogs\\n which implied that a student will be disbarred from registering for one semester and hence would be unable to complete their course on time. Apart from this, this would also be in the official record of the student including the final grade transcript.\\n\\nConsequence\\n\\nA group of 27 1st year students were told to undergo community service for 2 months during the summer months of May and June 2014. There was no other official record made anywhere regarding this event.\\n[\\nunverified\\n]\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThe events of MT Hall Day 2014 were a classic case of the Bandwagon effect. The destruction was started by a small subset of people attending the Hall Day. It started as a joke, and eventually turned into a competition between the various societies on campus.\\n\\nInterestingly, some of the women who resided in the hall, who were acting as hosts in the hall day decided to preclude the possibility of destruction by locking themselves inside their rooms and not letting anyone in. Some of the male friends of these women who had locked their doors to outsiders then tried to fish them out of there by filling buckets with water and then throwing them into the room using the slit under the door. It must be noted that a similar method is used to lure cockroaches out of hiding spots in kitchen drains, that must definitely have been the source of this particular strategy.\\n\\nWhile some other women decided to give in, and some even participated in the destruction of their friend\\'s rooms. Claims can also be made about this being a direct application of the herd behaviour in real life. There have been \\nseveral\\n riots in the past that have been attributed to this particular characteristic of human behaviour.\\n\\nOn a brighter side, there were people who were trying to stop this from happening. Shushman Choudhury (CS, \\'15) was on the ground floor and was trying to stop people from throwing down mattresses by shouting at them. He gave up after about 15 minutes of this (it was rather dangerous to stand on the ground floor where the possibility of a mattress hitting you is non-significant), but it must be said that it must have taken considerable courage to even try to do something like this against a mob, that for all practical purposes, had lost all control on themselves and had stopped computing the turn of events, the consequences of the same and the state of the hall as it stood around them.\\n\\nLess attention is paid to the aftermath and the administration\\'s response to this event. The administration decided to witch-hunt a small group of people and decided to get a list of names and proceed with punishing them. They decided to talk to the women whose rooms were trashed in an attempt to get the names of their male friends who did the trashing out of them. This strategy didn\\'t work out well at first. Most women flat out refused to talk. Soon, the administration started using the only chip they had: threatening the woman with disciplinary proceedings for not cooperating. Soon enough, it was clear to all the women that this was not going away and that they had to come up with names or get ready to face the heat of saving their friends.\\n\\nGiven a choice, several women chose to name a few friends who they thought would be wildly off the administration\\'s radar and it would be very hard to actually punish them because it would be obvious to everyone that these people were not responsible, but the administration didn\\'t care about this and went ahead and prepared the list of 40-50 people who were going to do the community service in the summer. This list had a few people who had been included because only the first name had been provided by the women and there were several people with that name in the UG batch. One such person got his father to fly out to Kharagpur and talk to the director directly about what was going on and why this kind of mob justice was being handed out. His name was removed from the list subsequently.\\n\\nThe names of some other people were also included in this list although their connection to the events was non-existent. People who had been at home during the weekend of the events or who had been in the hall for a very short period of time were on this list. Some people were able to get their names off the list.\\n\\nThe administration\\'s tactics were simple: they set about intimidating 18 year olds into tattling on their friends. While many might imagine that in the same situation, they would have behaved in an honorable manner, one is forced to imagine what the conditions must have been like if nearly 50 names could be squeezed out of a population of highly un-cooperative women.\\n\\nSee Also\\n\\nHall Day\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n↑\\n\\n\"Open Letter of Condemnation | MT Hall day\"\\n - VP TSG 2013-2014 Apoorv Jain\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=2014-03-07_MT_Hall_Day_Incident&oldid=97174\\n\"', 'metadata': {'title': '2014-03-07 MT Hall Day Incident', 'url': 'https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/2014-03-07_MT_Hall_Day_Incident', 'timestamp': '2025-02-04 11:23:18', 'source_type': 'wiki_entry'}}\n",

The IIT Kharagpur branch of 180 Degrees Consulting (abbreviated as 180DC) was founded in April 2020 by Amritash Bharadwaj, Nikita Kishore, Adarsh Gupta, Aniket Shah and Keshav Godala with an aim to provide quality consultancy services to socially conscious corporations and NGOs to help them achieve the impact they seek to create.\\n\\nBeing students of the oldest, largest and most versatile of IITs, the team consists of driven and capable people with diverse skill sets across various fields. It is a platform where students can gain leadership skills, consulting experience and professional etiquette with a chance to derive value through the quality of their collaborative work.\\n\\nFunctioning\\n\\nSelections\\n\\nSelection procedures for 180DC are held at the start of the autumn semester. New recruits are taken in from second year only. The selection procedure consists of multiple rounds of interviews and discussions wherein prospective members aren’t judged on their knowledge of consultancy frameworks, but rather their problem-solving approach and whether they are able to present their thoughts in a structured manner.\\xa0  \\n\\nThe selection procedure evaluates the candidates on \\nStructured Thinking, Problem Solving, Work Ethic, Time Management,\\xa0Speaking, Writing and Design skills\\n. Good knowledge of business and finance is appreciated but is not the main factor of evaluation. We expect an optimal amount of time and dedication. \\n\\nKnowledge Meetings\\n\\nThe main opportunity to learn in 180 Degrees Consulting is via knowledge meetings. Seniors organise knowledge meetings to polish the skills of new recruits and also teach them various consulting techniques and frameworks. These knowledge meetings also involve case study competitions/workshops.\\n\\nOrganisational Structure\\n\\nAdvisors\\n consist of fourth and fifth-year members and are the senior-most members whose experience helps in guiding the overall direction of the organisation.\\n\\nDirectors\\n are members who are in their third and fourth year of study. They are responsible for heading various different portfolios and projects within the organisation.\\n\\nSenior Consultants\\n are the members who are in their second and third year of study. They are responsible for executing the portfolio and project work assigned by the Directors.\\n\\nConsultants\\n comprises the students who are in the second year. They take care of executing various plans and projects of 180DC\\n\\nAdvisors and Directors\\n\\nAdvisors (2020-2021)\\n\\nAmritash Bharadwaj ( Founder )\\n\\nNikita Kishore\\n\\nDirectors (2020-2021)\\n\\nAdarsh Gupta\\n\\nAniket Shah\\n\\nKeshav Godala\\n\\nAdvisors (2021-2022)\\n\\nAmritash Bharadwaj ( Founder )\\n\\nNikita Kishore\\n\\nAdarsh Gupta\\n\\nAniket Shah\\n\\nKeshav Godala\\n\\nDirectors (2021-2022)\\n\\nAneeta James\\n\\nBhavik Jain\\n\\nDivyansh Dewra\\n\\nGauranshi Chauhan\\n\\nHarshal Dupare\\n\\nHimanshu Dang\\n\\nIshan Das\\n\\nTanishq Bansal\\n\\nOur Work\\n\\nProjects\\n\\nThe organisation’s work includes client negotiation, acquisition, onboarding and providing consultancy services to clients. The services include (but are not limited to) evaluating project feasibility, providing financial and CSR strategies, doing market research & data analysis etc. The deliverables provided have helped several NGOs and organisations in many ways like helping them getting more funds, solving infrastructural/systemic problems, acquiring more volunteers etc.  \\n\\n180DC has collaborated with various renowned organisations, some of them are listed below: \\n\\n1) Mahila Saksham Foundation \\xa0\\n\\n2) World Vision India\\n\\n3) Government of MP\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n4) Robin Hood Army\\n\\n5) Think Sharp\\n\\n6) Fytorem\\n\\n7) Cuddles\\n\\n8) Genesis\\n\\nSome of the top feedback which we have received from various clients:\\n\\n1) Government of MP\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\nClient Feedback:\\n “180 Degrees Consulting IIT Kharagpur was of immense help in making policies to recover revenue loss faced by the Madhya Pradesh Government due to COVID-19 pandemic.

The syllabus mentions things like system modeling with differential equations, transfer functions, state space analysis, control objectives, stability criteria, and more.\n",

      "I think the main areas to focus on are system modeling, control theory basics, classical stability analysis, modern control methods, and dynamic systems. From the classroom resources, there's a lot about dynamics of sensors and actuators, trajectory optimization, and flight mechanics. These seem crucial for understanding how flight vehicles behave and control them effectively.\n",

      "content=\"<think>\\nOkay, so I have this question about whether someone with a CGPA of 7.3 can register for an Additional Subject. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I know that CGPA stands for Cumulative Grade Point Average. It's like the average grade someone has earned up to a certain point in their academic career. So if someone has a CGPA of 7.3, they're pretty high. But does that mean they can take an Additional Subject?\\n\\nI remember that some universities have specific rules about this. I think it depends on whether they're applying for undergraduate or postgraduate programs. For undergrads, I believe you need to have a CGPA of at least 4.0. So if someone has 7.3, they should be fine.\\n\\nBut wait, what about postgraduates? I'm not sure. Maybe the requirement is different there. Let me check my notes or textbooks. Oh right, for postgraduates, it might still require a CGPA of around 4.0 or higher. So even if someone is in grad school, having a CGPA of 7.3 should be okay.\\n\\nAnother thing to consider is the Additional Subject requirement. I think some universities allow you to take an extra subject beyond your main degree. But again, it depends on the program. If they require a certain CGPA for that, then maybe not everyone can register. However, if the school doesn't have such a strict requirement, especially if it's a general education course, then 7.3 should be enough.\\n\\nI also wonder about the grading system. Some schools use a different scale than others. If they're using a 4-point scale, 7.3 is way above average. But if it's a 5-point scale, maybe that's still acceptable. I'm not sure how CGPA is calculated in their specific program.\\n\\nWait, another point: sometimes universities have a policy where you can take an Additional Subject only after completing your degree. So even with a high CGPA, if they don't allow it yet, you might need to wait until you finish. But the question doesn't mention that, so I think it's assuming you're applying for registration now.\\n\\nAlso, some schools might have specific rules about how many Additional Subjects you can take. If there are restrictions, then even with a high CGPA, you might not be eligible. But without knowing the specifics of the school, it's hard to say.\\n\\nIn summary, if the school allows Additional Subjects and doesn't have strict CGPA requirements beyond 4.0 or similar, someone with 7.3 should be able to register. However, I'm not entirely sure about all the details, so maybe I should check a few universities' websites or contact their admissions office for clarification.\\n</think>\\n\\nBased on the thought process and considerations outlined:\\n\\n- **Undergraduate Programs**: A CGPA of 7.3 is typically acceptable for undergraduate programs requiring at least a CGPA of 4.0.\\n\\n- **Postgraduate Programs**: The requirement may vary, but generally, a CGPA of around 4.0 or higher is sufficient unless specific policies apply.\\n\\n- **Additional Subject Registration**: If the school allows Additional Subjects and does not have strict CGPA requirements beyond 4.0, someone with a CGPA of 7.3 should be eligible.\\n\\n- **Universities-Specific Rules**: It's important to check each university's specific policy regarding CGPA for Additional Subjects and registration restrictions.\\n\\n**Conclusion**: If the school allows Additional Subjects and does not have strict CGPA requirements beyond 4.0, someone with a CGPA of 7.3 should be able to register. However, it's advisable to verify this directly with the target university.\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'model': 'deepseek-r1:1.5b', 'created_at': '2025-02-24T15:04:38.2445254Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 14410045800, 'load_duration': 19814800, 'prompt_eval_count': 31, 'prompt_eval_duration': 25000000, 'eval_count': 772, 'eval_duration': 14362000000, 'message': Message(role='assistant', content='', images=None, tool_calls=None)} id='run-9be2eb14-4a6a-4705-8c75-ca2a5e468b2f-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 31, 'output_tokens': 772, 'total_tokens': 803}\n"

      "content='<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out the CG criteria for an interdisciplinary program. Hmm, I\\'m not entirely sure what that means. Let me start by breaking down the terms.\\n\\nFirst, \"CG\" probably stands for something like \"Curriculum Guidelines,\" but maybe it\\'s more specific. Interdisciplinary programs combine different fields of study, so maybe the CG needs to reflect that. I think curriculum guidelines usually outline course requirements and learning objectives. So, for an interdisciplinary program, those would need to be tailored to integrate multiple disciplines.\\n\\nI remember seeing something about academic units or departments in universities having their own guidelines. Maybe each department has its own CG criteria. That makes sense because different fields might have different expectations for what\\'s important. For example, a biology department might require more lab work and experiments, while a computer science department might focus on coding and technology.\\n\\nI should also consider how the interdisciplinary program itself is structured. It probably requires students to take courses from multiple departments or units. So, the CG criteria would need to ensure that these courses are integrated properly. Maybe there\\'s a specific number of required courses from each discipline, or perhaps some electives that allow flexibility within the interdisciplinary framework.\\n\\nAnother thing to think about is how assessments work. In an interdisciplinary program, exams might be more comprehensive since students have to demonstrate understanding across multiple subjects. The CG criteria would need to outline how these assessments are conducted and evaluated.\\n\\nI also wonder about the workload. Interdisciplinary programs can be challenging because they require balancing knowledge from different areas. So, the CG criteria might include guidelines on course load, time commitment per week or semester, and any additional responsibilities students might have outside of academics.\\n\\nMaybe there\\'s a focus on critical thinking and problem-solving skills since it\\'s interdisciplinary. The curriculum should encourage students to apply knowledge across disciplines to solve complex problems. That would mean including projects or case studies that require integrating information from various fields.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure about the specific percentages for each discipline, but I think they might be set by the academic units themselves. For example, a biology and chemistry department might allocate 40% of their curriculum to biology courses, while a computer science department could have 30%. The interdisciplinary program would then integrate these into its overall structure.\\n\\nAlso, there might be a requirement for a certain number of credit hours from each discipline. If the interdisciplinary program is 120 credit hours, maybe 48 from biology, 36 from chemistry, and 36 from computer science. That way, it\\'s balanced across all areas.\\n\\nI should also consider any specific courses or electives that are part of the interdisciplinary requirement. These might include capstone projects, research papers, or collaborative assignments where students work across disciplines.\\n\\nIn terms of learning outcomes, the CG criteria would outline what students should know and be able to do after completing the program. This includes not only knowledge from each discipline but also the ability to integrate information and apply it in new contexts.\\n\\nI\\'m a bit fuzzy on how assessments are handled. Are they based on participation, projects, exams, or a combination? The CG criteria would need to specify this so that everyone understands how student performance is evaluated.\\n\\nLastly, I think there might be a focus on developing soft skills like teamwork and communication since it\\'s an interdisciplinary program. The curriculum should encourage collaboration across different fields and present students with opportunities to work together on projects.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the CG criteria for an interdisciplinary program would likely include specific course requirements from each discipline, balanced workload, integration of knowledge across areas, critical thinking, assessments that evaluate a range of skills, and a focus on teamwork and communication. Each academic unit might have its own set of guidelines to ensure consistency and effectiveness.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe curriculum guidelines (CG) for an interdisciplinary program are structured to integrate knowledge from multiple disciplines, ensuring students develop comprehensive skills. Here\\'s a concise breakdown:\\n\\n1. **Course Requirements**: Each discipline within the program must contribute a specific number of credit hours. For example, biology might account for 40%, chemistry 30%, and computer science 30%.\\n\\n2. **Workload**: The interdisciplinary program balances academic load with practical application. This may include courses that require both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience.\\n\\n3. **Assessment**: Assessments are comprehensive, evaluating understanding across disciplines through exams, projects, and case studies.\\n\\n4. **Critical Thinking and Problem Solving**: Interdisciplinary programs emphasize integrating information to solve complex problems, encouraging students to apply knowledge from various fields.\\n\\n5. **Teamwork and Communication**: The curriculum fosters collaboration, with opportunities for teamwork and communication in projects and assignments.\\n\\n6. **Learning Outcomes**: Students are expected to demonstrate a range of skills, including knowledge retention, application, and integration across disciplines.\\n\\n7. **Academic Units\\' Guidelines**: Each department may have specific CG criteria, ensuring consistency and alignment within the program structure.\\n\\nIn summary, the interdisciplinary program\\'s curriculum is designed to integrate multiple fields, balance academic load, assess comprehensive skills, and encourage teamwork and communication, all while aligning with each discipline\\'s specific requirements.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'model': 'deepseek-r1:1.5b', 'created_at': '2025-02-24T14:49:19.2148151Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 20263924000, 'load_duration': 21528900, 'prompt_eval_count': 22, 'prompt_eval_duration': 15000000, 'eval_count': 1032, 'eval_duration': 20215000000, 'message': Message(role='assistant', content='', images=None, tool_calls=None)} id='run-ac588e11-e62b-4258-9951-4e1c969a43fa-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 22, 'output_tokens': 1032, 'total_tokens': 1054}\n"

      "Okay, so I need to figure out how the food in PFC at IIT KGP is. Let me start by recalling what I know. I've heard that IIT KGP is an engineering college, and they have a hostel called PFC. The question is about their food service.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should think about what I know regarding hostel food services. Typically, hostels offer different types of meals throughout the day. Maybe breakfast, lunch, dinner, and maybe even snacks in between. I remember that some hostels have a fixed menu or a rotating schedule where they serve different dishes each meal time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also recall that many hostels have a policy about backlogs. If there's a backlog, it usually means students are waiting for meals because the previous meal wasn't served on time. So, if PFC is their hostel, I should check if they have any such policies or if everyone gets their meal promptly without any issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another point to consider is whether the food service is consistent throughout the day. Some hostels might serve breakfast late in the morning and dinner early in the evening, which could be a problem for students who arrive late. But I think PFC might try to accommodate that by having flexible schedules or offering meals at different times if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about any special provisions for students. Maybe there are discounts or packages for certain groups like seniors or students with health issues. It's possible that PFC offers a variety of options, including vegetarian or non-vegetarian options, depending on the student's dietary needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I wonder if PFC has any facilities to ensure food safety and quality. Perhaps they have trained staff, clean areas, and maybe even some amenities like tables for students to sit at during meals. This would make it easier for students to eat comfortably without worrying about food issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider the time of day when students arrive. If PFC is open 24 hours or has a late-night option, that could be an advantage. But if they close early, maybe students have to wait longer for meals. I think many hostels do offer late-night options, so that might not be a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the food in PFC at IIT KGP likely includes a variety of meal times throughout the day, with consistent service and possibly some flexibility for students who arrive late or need special meals. They probably have policies to handle backlogs and ensure quality, along with any necessary facilities to make dining convenient.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The food service at PFC, the hostel of IIT KGP, is designed to provide a comprehensive and flexible dining experience. Here's an organized overview:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Meal Schedule**: \n",
      "   - PFC offers breakfast, lunch, dinner, and may also include snacks during different meal times throughout the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Backlog Management**:\n",
      "   - The hostel likely has policies in place to handle backlogs, accommodating students who arrive late by offering flexible schedules or providing meals at various times if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consistency and Quality**:\n",
      "   - Food is typically prepared with a fixed menu or rotating options, ensuring variety and quality for all students.\n",
      "   - PFC may offer special provisions such as discounts or packages for seniors or those with dietary needs, enhancing the dining experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Facilities**:\n",
      "   - The hostel likely has trained staff, clean areas, and amenities to ensure food safety and comfort, including late-night options if available.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Time of Day**:\n",
      "   - PFC may offer 24-hour service or late-night options, accommodating students who arrive late without compromising on meal quality.\n",
