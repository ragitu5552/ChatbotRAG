      "{'text': 'On March 7th 2014, during MT Hall day students damaged furniture, threw them from the top floor and made graffiti on the walls. In some rooms fans were also bent. The event was widely condemned by authority and student community.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1\\n\\nDetails\\n\\n1.1\\n\\nTimeline\\n\\n1.2\\n\\nA list of things that happened\\n\\n2\\n\\nAftermath\\n\\n2.1\\n\\nAdministration\\n\\n2.2\\n\\nEmails sent by the VP TSG\\n\\n2.3\\n\\nMeetings between the student community and the VP TSG\\n\\n2.3.1\\n\\nFirst meeting\\n\\n2.3.2\\n\\nSecond meeting\\n\\n3\\n\\nConsequence\\n\\n4\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n5\\n\\nSee Also\\n\\n6\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nDetails\\n\\nImages:\\n\\nBent Fan\\n\\nThings thrown from top floor\\n\\nVandalized bed\\n\\nThe hall day proceedings started at about 7 pm as usual. This was the first hall day for the UG 1st year students (who joined the institute in July 2013). A soft rule was put in place requiring girls who had invited their male friends to come to the door and escort them inside. This rule was not enforced very rigidly. Security at the gates of the hall checked the ID Card of every student who was going into the hall.\\n\\nAfter entering the hall, students were milling around for about an hour or so, understanding the geography of the hall presumably and taking it all in, because this was the \\nonly day\\n that they were going to be allowed inside the hall for the next 1 year. This was also the first time that they had a taste of the hall day culture. Much had been made of this tradition by most seniors from societies that about 1/4th of the UG 1st year batch were part of.\\n\\nAround 8:15 PM, trouble started when some unruly activities started on the top floor where some first year female students lived. Boys were being pushed out of the room and boxes of surf, tubes of toothpaste were being dumped and squeezed onto their clothes. Presumably, the girls residing in these rooms did not say anything to stop this distressing behavior (perhaps even vocally supporting it) and allowed the act to continue. Quickly, things escalated to a point where mattresses and pillows were being thrown from the second and first floors onto the garden on the ground floor which had been fixed for the Hall Day. Even until this point, this was nothing more than a joke. This is where the tone of things changed into a competition.\\n\\nMembers of various societies started forming human chains and singing songs and marching around the floors and the stair cases. These chains had both male and female members and they were going from a room of one of their members to another one of their members. Allegedly, all the members were from first year, and although seniors were residing in this part of the hall, they did not intervene.\\n\\nSome seniors from 3rd and 4th years were seen walking around the in the ground in the center of the hall where the mattresses were being thrown and trying to convince people vocally to stop throwing things and behaving in an unruly manner. This call to regain control and stop the events went mostly unheeded.\\n\\nThe whole destruction went on for about an hour unchecked, due to some gross mishandling by the MT Hall President, VP TSG and the hall security guards, who were present on the premises for the whole evening but did not act.\\n\\nAt 9:15 pm - 9:30 pm, the hall day was brought to an end (approximately 30 minutes before the scheduled end), and everyone was asked to leave. All the men were herded around and summarily expelled from the hall. The mood among most students was celebratory. It is safe to assume that the destruction that they had done and the consequences of the same had not yet sunk in. After the hall-day, discussion regarding what happened was mostly done with a fair bit of humor and the event was filed away in memory for nearly 2 weeks. Some girls whose rooms were trashed talked about how it was unfair for their LAN ports to be broken and their only fault being that they had invited their friends into their rooms.\\n\\nTimeline\\n\\nA list of things that happened\\n\\nFans bent out of shape (see image)\\n\\nBeds thrown from as high up as the third floor onto the ground floor\\n\\nLAN ports broken\\n\\nObscene phrases on the walls of some rooms (references to the male and female reproductive organs using slang terms in English and Hindi)\\n\\nAftermath\\n\\nAdministration\\n\\nAt the time of this event, the following were the people who held different important positions.\\n\\nEmails sent by the VP TSG\\n\\nThe Vice President (TSG) at the time of the incident was Apoorv Jain. On 9th March, 2014, he sent an email to all students enclosing images of the destruction caused. He severely condemned this event. The attached images immediately found their way to Facebook, and subsequently to Quora where several questions asking \"why\" these events had happened at a prestigious institute such as IIT Kharagpur. As most first year students were dazed by the destruction they had enabled and participated in, no one had thought or been allowed to take pictures before being expelled from MT Hall. Pictures that did exist had not been widely circulated or posted on Facebook. So, in essence, if the VP TSG had decided not to include pictures of the destruction in his email, there would have been none in public circulation for anyone to look at.\\n\\nDear Students,\\n\\nThis letter is in regards to the recent occurrence of damage to institute property on 7th March, 2014 during Mother Teresa Hall Day. In a span of fifteen minutes, furniture in the rooms of several first year undergraduate students was either broken, damaged beyond repair or thrown from the top floors. Furthermore, the walls were defaced with obscene graffiti. The fact that few students indulged in such act of vandalism reflects poorly on the entire student community of IIT Kharagpur.\\n\\nThis heinous act of mass wreckage showed lack of respect for institute property and, more importantly, lack of character and morals in the offenders, and has left the student community of IIT Kharagpur equivalent of street ragamuffins. This kind of crude behaviour as shown in pictures attached is not expected of students of the forerunner of the IITs. IIT Kharagpur is not a mere academic institution, we boast of a rich fraternal culture, which is developed through a deep sense of gratitude towards the institute. Sadly, incident like this have raised a question on whether our freedom is compromising our civility and whether we deserve such infrastructural facilities.\\n\\nWe, the Office bearers of Technology Students\\' Gymkhana and all Hall Presidents are extremely disturbed by this irresponsible and dishonourable behaviour of our own students. Visibly, students have failed to capture the real essence of Hall Days. We hope students understand the gravity of the situation and refrain from such undignified activities in future.\\n\\nThank you\\nWith Regards\\nApoorv Jain\\nVP,TSG\\n\\nOn 19th March, 2014, at around 8 am, he sent this email to all the UG 1st year students.\\n\\nDear Students,\\n\\nToday, Prof N R Mandal (Dean, SA) will address all the UG 1st year students regarding MT Hall Day incident. So, all the students are kindly requested to be present in Netaji Auditorium at 6.30 pm.\\n\\nThank you\\n\\nWith Regards\\n\\nApoorv Jain\\nVP,TSG\\n\\nMeetings between the student community and the VP TSG\\n\\nFirst meeting\\n\\nOn 19th March, 2014, the whole UG 1st year batch (students who joined in 2013) was called for a meeting at Netaji Auditorium at 6:30 pm. Apoorv Jain sent out this email at around 8 am that morning.\\n\\nThis meeting was attended by then Dean (Student Affairs) Prof N R Mandal, then President TSG Prof. Joy Sen, VP TSG Apoorv Jain and a few hall presidents. The turn out at the 6:30 pm meeting was very less. (approximately 50-70 people out of a total UG 1st year batch of 1400 people)\\n\\nThe meeting was delayed and students who were present there were intimidated into manually calling their friends to the venue, this marginally increased the turn out. The intimidation was done by the VP TSG who was present there, along with some fourth year hall presidents who were visibly angry and disappointed with the turnout. Absurd threats were made against the few obedient students who had turned up. Eg: \\nAgar tumhara pura batch yahan nahi aayega, to yahan pe jitne bhi log hain, tum sab pe DC baithegi. Phir udhar jaake jawaab de dena.\\n (If your whole batch doesn\\'t get here, all of you who are present here will be acted upon by the Disciplinary Committee. You can then explain your situation there.)\\n\\nAround 7:30 pm, the professors arrived at \\nNetaji Auditorium\\n. A long address followed. Students present at this meeting were informed that the 12 day delay was because of then DOSA Prof. N R Mandal being out of station and thus being unable to act on the events. This delay was not to be misinterpreted as an unwillingness to act. Allusions were also made to the VP, President and other professors of the institute getting phone calls from alumni regarding the MT Hall Day incident. One of the things that stood out at this meeting, which was discussed for several weeks after this meeting, was Prof. Joy Sen\\'s famous reference to the 1979 Mel Gibson classic \\nMad Max\\n. He particularly pointed out the end of the 1979 movie where Mel Gibson\\'s character Max loses control over himself, after losing his family, and kills several members of the gang that was involved in the death of his wife and his infant son. Prof. Sen\\'s was trying to draw an analogy between the behavior of a few out of control freshman and the protagonist in a movie who does something explicable, but rather bizarre. While most people at this first meeting had not seen the movie Prof. Sen was talking about, it was clear to almost everyone present that he was grappling with what had happened and trying to make sense of it using the appreciated principle of \"life imitating art\"\\n\\nStudents present there were also informed by the VP TSG that there was widespread disappointment in the behavior of the UG 1st year students, and that since the General Championships had been suspended right after the incident on 7th March, there was considerable anger among students in senior batches.\\n\\nAll professors present at the meeting were irritated with the low turnout and left about 1 hour after the meeting started in an agitated state. Apoorv Jain then decided to convene a complete UG 1st year batch meeting at 9 pm that night. There was widespread panic about what the consequences would be. There were several threats (such as mass Disciplinary Committee action, barring from placement, etc) which were indirectly made by the VP TSG and other hall presidents present at the meeting. The ultimatum was to get the whole batch at Netaji Auditorium at 9 pm and then, the discussion would be about the possible recourse that could be taken to mitigate the event\\'s fall out.\\n\\nSecond meeting\\n\\nThe second meeting began at 9 pm and saw much higher turnout, with almost the whole UG 1st year batch turning up. People were found in MMM and LBS Halls of residences literally running around calling their friends and everyone in 1st year to this meeting. There was widespread panic regarding the threats that had been made. Notably, none of the professors came to this meeting. The meeting was attended by the hall presidents of Patel, Nehru, MT, SN/IG, apart from then VP TSG. This was viewed as a scare tactic, as some of the hall presidents referred to the absence of Orientation Procedure / OP for first years was somehow responsible for this behavior. Their direct implication was that people were running around wild because they had not been \"trained in the ways of KGP\". Referring to the suspension of the GCs as a result of the main incident, one of the Hall Presidents said, \\nTum logon ko pata nahi hain ki iska kya matlab hain, sab log bahut gusse mein hain. Agle sal jab tum log senior hall jaoge to tumhe pata chalega\\n (You don\\'t know about the importance of the GCs being suspended, everyone is angry about this. You all will face the consequences for this next year, when you go to senior halls)\\n\\nSome of the options discussed in this meeting included a reduced community service for the whole UG 1st year batch, so as to save a few people from getting a lot of the punishment. When the students present in the auditorium were asked, \\nAre you all willing to take the blame and stay back and do community service for the summer, so that not just a few of your friends face really bad consequences?\\n, a few students immediately shot down the idea. The general consensus among students who had not attended the hall day, had not witnessed the incident, and/or were completely not involved in the incident was that they should not have to pay with their time for the mistakes of a few groups of people. \\n\\nThe VP TSG made an effort to try to get traction for the shared punishment idea. He asked if anyone would like to defend it and try to convince their batch mates. Understandably, students who had been spotted by many people as being the main players in the destruction were in total support of this idea of shared blame to reduce the punishment. They were seen visibly confused and voiced their concerns with one student standing up and addressing the rest of the auditorium: \\nDekh lo yaar, sab log lenge blame toh sirf ek mahina rehna padega, nahi toh pata nahi kya hoga.\\n (If everyone takes the blame, the punishment will be very less and everyone would have to stay back only for 1 month. If not, we don\\'t know what the punishment might be)\\n\\nTensions were even higher than at the previous meeting because for the first time Apoorv Jain said that one of the common punishments doled out after disciplinary committee hearings were \"semester backlogs\\n which implied that a student will be disbarred from registering for one semester and hence would be unable to complete their course on time. Apart from this, this would also be in the official record of the student including the final grade transcript.\\n\\nConsequence\\n\\nA group of 27 1st year students were told to undergo community service for 2 months during the summer months of May and June 2014. There was no other official record made anywhere regarding this event.\\n[\\nunverified\\n]\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThe events of MT Hall Day 2014 were a classic case of the Bandwagon effect. The destruction was started by a small subset of people attending the Hall Day. It started as a joke, and eventually turned into a competition between the various societies on campus.\\n\\nInterestingly, some of the women who resided in the hall, who were acting as hosts in the hall day decided to preclude the possibility of destruction by locking themselves inside their rooms and not letting anyone in. Some of the male friends of these women who had locked their doors to outsiders then tried to fish them out of there by filling buckets with water and then throwing them into the room using the slit under the door. It must be noted that a similar method is used to lure cockroaches out of hiding spots in kitchen drains, that must definitely have been the source of this particular strategy.\\n\\nWhile some other women decided to give in, and some even participated in the destruction of their friend\\'s rooms. Claims can also be made about this being a direct application of the herd behaviour in real life. There have been \\nseveral\\n riots in the past that have been attributed to this particular characteristic of human behaviour.\\n\\nOn a brighter side, there were people who were trying to stop this from happening. Shushman Choudhury (CS, \\'15) was on the ground floor and was trying to stop people from throwing down mattresses by shouting at them. He gave up after about 15 minutes of this (it was rather dangerous to stand on the ground floor where the possibility of a mattress hitting you is non-significant), but it must be said that it must have taken considerable courage to even try to do something like this against a mob, that for all practical purposes, had lost all control on themselves and had stopped computing the turn of events, the consequences of the same and the state of the hall as it stood around them.\\n\\nLess attention is paid to the aftermath and the administration\\'s response to this event. The administration decided to witch-hunt a small group of people and decided to get a list of names and proceed with punishing them. They decided to talk to the women whose rooms were trashed in an attempt to get the names of their male friends who did the trashing out of them. This strategy didn\\'t work out well at first. Most women flat out refused to talk. Soon, the administration started using the only chip they had: threatening the woman with disciplinary proceedings for not cooperating. Soon enough, it was clear to all the women that this was not going away and that they had to come up with names or get ready to face the heat of saving their friends.\\n\\nGiven a choice, several women chose to name a few friends who they thought would be wildly off the administration\\'s radar and it would be very hard to actually punish them because it would be obvious to everyone that these people were not responsible, but the administration didn\\'t care about this and went ahead and prepared the list of 40-50 people who were going to do the community service in the summer. This list had a few people who had been included because only the first name had been provided by the women and there were several people with that name in the UG batch. One such person got his father to fly out to Kharagpur and talk to the director directly about what was going on and why this kind of mob justice was being handed out. His name was removed from the list subsequently.\\n\\nThe names of some other people were also included in this list although their connection to the events was non-existent. People who had been at home during the weekend of the events or who had been in the hall for a very short period of time were on this list. Some people were able to get their names off the list.\\n\\nThe administration\\'s tactics were simple: they set about intimidating 18 year olds into tattling on their friends. While many might imagine that in the same situation, they would have behaved in an honorable manner, one is forced to imagine what the conditions must have been like if nearly 50 names could be squeezed out of a population of highly un-cooperative women.\\n\\nSee Also\\n\\nHall Day\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n↑\\n\\n\"Open Letter of Condemnation | MT Hall day\"\\n - VP TSG 2013-2014 Apoorv Jain\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=2014-03-07_MT_Hall_Day_Incident&oldid=97174\\n\"', 'metadata': {'title': '2014-03-07 MT Hall Day Incident', 'url': 'https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/2014-03-07_MT_Hall_Day_Incident', 'timestamp': '2025-02-04 11:23:18', 'source_type': 'wiki_entry'}}\n",

The IIT Kharagpur branch of 180 Degrees Consulting (abbreviated as 180DC) was founded in April 2020 by Amritash Bharadwaj, Nikita Kishore, Adarsh Gupta, Aniket Shah and Keshav Godala with an aim to provide quality consultancy services to socially conscious corporations and NGOs to help them achieve the impact they seek to create.\\n\\nBeing students of the oldest, largest and most versatile of IITs, the team consists of driven and capable people with diverse skill sets across various fields. It is a platform where students can gain leadership skills, consulting experience and professional etiquette with a chance to derive value through the quality of their collaborative work.\\n\\nFunctioning\\n\\nSelections\\n\\nSelection procedures for 180DC are held at the start of the autumn semester. New recruits are taken in from second year only. The selection procedure consists of multiple rounds of interviews and discussions wherein prospective members aren’t judged on their knowledge of consultancy frameworks, but rather their problem-solving approach and whether they are able to present their thoughts in a structured manner.\\xa0  \\n\\nThe selection procedure evaluates the candidates on \\nStructured Thinking, Problem Solving, Work Ethic, Time Management,\\xa0Speaking, Writing and Design skills\\n. Good knowledge of business and finance is appreciated but is not the main factor of evaluation. We expect an optimal amount of time and dedication. \\n\\nKnowledge Meetings\\n\\nThe main opportunity to learn in 180 Degrees Consulting is via knowledge meetings. Seniors organise knowledge meetings to polish the skills of new recruits and also teach them various consulting techniques and frameworks. These knowledge meetings also involve case study competitions/workshops.\\n\\nOrganisational Structure\\n\\nAdvisors\\n consist of fourth and fifth-year members and are the senior-most members whose experience helps in guiding the overall direction of the organisation.\\n\\nDirectors\\n are members who are in their third and fourth year of study. They are responsible for heading various different portfolios and projects within the organisation.\\n\\nSenior Consultants\\n are the members who are in their second and third year of study. They are responsible for executing the portfolio and project work assigned by the Directors.\\n\\nConsultants\\n comprises the students who are in the second year.

      "{'text': 'On March 7th 2014, during MT Hall day students damaged furniture, threw them from the top floor and made graffiti on the walls. In some rooms fans were also bent. The event was widely condemned by authority and student community.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1\\n\\nDetails\\n\\n1.1\\n\\nTimeline\\n\\n1.2\\n\\nA list of things that happened\\n\\n2\\n\\nAftermath\\n\\n2.1\\n\\nAdministration\\n\\n2.2\\n\\nEmails sent by the VP TSG\\n\\n2.3\\n\\nMeetings between the student community and the VP TSG\\n\\n2.3.1\\n\\nFirst meeting\\n\\n2.3.2\\n\\nSecond meeting\\n\\n3\\n\\nConsequence\\n\\n4\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\n5\\n\\nSee Also\\n\\n6\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nDetails\\n\\nImages:\\n\\nBent Fan\\n\\nThings thrown from top floor\\n\\nVandalized bed\\n\\nThe hall day proceedings started at about 7 pm as usual. This was the first hall day for the UG 1st year students (who joined the institute in July 2013). A soft rule was put in place requiring girls who had invited their male friends to come to the door and escort them inside. This rule was not enforced very rigidly. Security at the gates of the hall checked the ID Card of every student who was going into the hall.\\n\\nAfter entering the hall, students were milling around for about an hour or so, understanding the geography of the hall presumably and taking it all in, because this was the \\nonly day\\n that they were going to be allowed inside the hall for the next 1 year. This was also the first time that they had a taste of the hall day culture. Much had been made of this tradition by most seniors from societies that about 1/4th of the UG 1st year batch were part of.\\n\\nAround 8:15 PM, trouble started when some unruly activities started on the top floor where some first year female students lived. Boys were being pushed out of the room and boxes of surf, tubes of toothpaste were being dumped and squeezed onto their clothes. Presumably, the girls residing in these rooms did not say anything to stop this distressing behavior (perhaps even vocally supporting it) and allowed the act to continue. Quickly, things escalated to a point where mattresses and pillows were being thrown from the second and first floors onto the garden on the ground floor which had been fixed for the Hall Day. Even until this point, this was nothing more than a joke. This is where the tone of things changed into a competition.\\n\\nMembers of various societies started forming human chains and singing songs and marching around the floors and the stair cases. These chains had both male and female members and they were going from a room of one of their members to another one of their members. Allegedly, all the members were from first year, and although seniors were residing in this part of the hall, they did not intervene.\\n\\nSome seniors from 3rd and 4th years were seen walking around the in the ground in the center of the hall where the mattresses were being thrown and trying to convince people vocally to stop throwing things and behaving in an unruly manner. This call to regain control and stop the events went mostly unheeded.\\n\\nThe whole destruction went on for about an hour unchecked, due to some gross mishandling by the MT Hall President, VP TSG and the hall security guards, who were present on the premises for the whole evening but did not act.\\n\\nAt 9:15 pm - 9:30 pm, the hall day was brought to an end (approximately 30 minutes before the scheduled end), and everyone was asked to leave. All the men were herded around and summarily expelled from the hall. The mood among most students was celebratory. It is safe to assume that the destruction that they had done and the consequences of the same had not yet sunk in. After the hall-day, discussion regarding what happened was mostly done with a fair bit of humor and the event was filed away in memory for nearly 2 weeks. Some girls whose rooms were trashed talked about how it was unfair for their LAN ports to be broken and their only fault being that they had invited their friends into their rooms.\\n\\nTimeline\\n\\nA list of things that happened\\n\\nFans bent out of shape (see image)\\n\\nBeds thrown from as high up as the third floor onto the ground floor\\n\\nLAN ports broken\\n\\nObscene phrases on the walls of some rooms (references to the male and female reproductive organs using slang terms in English and Hindi)\\n\\nAftermath\\n\\nAdministration\\n\\nAt the time of this event, the following were the people who held different important positions.\\n\\nEmails sent by the VP TSG\\n\\nThe Vice President (TSG) at the time of the incident was Apoorv Jain. On 9th March, 2014, he sent an email to all students enclosing images of the destruction caused. He severely condemned this event. The attached images immediately found their way to Facebook, and subsequently to Quora where several questions asking \"why\" these events had happened at a prestigious institute such as IIT Kharagpur. As most first year students were dazed by the destruction they had enabled and participated in, no one had thought or been allowed to take pictures before being expelled from MT Hall. Pictures that did exist had not been widely circulated or posted on Facebook. So, in essence, if the VP TSG had decided not to include pictures of the destruction in his email, there would have been none in public circulation for anyone to look at.\\n\\nDear Students,\\n\\nThis letter is in regards to the recent occurrence of damage to institute property on 7th March, 2014 during Mother Teresa Hall Day. In a span of fifteen minutes, furniture in the rooms of several first year undergraduate students was either broken, damaged beyond repair or thrown from the top floors. Furthermore, the walls were defaced with obscene graffiti. The fact that few students indulged in such act of vandalism reflects poorly on the entire student community of IIT Kharagpur.\\n\\nThis heinous act of mass wreckage showed lack of respect for institute property and, more importantly, lack of character and morals in the offenders, and has left the student community of IIT Kharagpur equivalent of street ragamuffins. This kind of crude behaviour as shown in pictures attached is not expected of students of the forerunner of the IITs. IIT Kharagpur is not a mere academic institution, we boast of a rich fraternal culture, which is developed through a deep sense of gratitude towards the institute. Sadly, incident like this have raised a question on whether our freedom is compromising our civility and whether we deserve such infrastructural facilities.\\n\\nWe, the Office bearers of Technology Students\\' Gymkhana and all Hall Presidents are extremely disturbed by this irresponsible and dishonourable behaviour of our own students. Visibly, students have failed to capture the real essence of Hall Days. We hope students understand the gravity of the situation and refrain from such undignified activities in future.\\n\\nThank you\\nWith Regards\\nApoorv Jain\\nVP,TSG\\n\\nOn 19th March, 2014, at around 8 am, he sent this email to all the UG 1st year students.\\n\\nDear Students,\\n\\nToday, Prof N R Mandal (Dean, SA) will address all the UG 1st year students regarding MT Hall Day incident. So, all the students are kindly requested to be present in Netaji Auditorium at 6.30 pm.\\n\\nThank you\\n\\nWith Regards\\n\\nApoorv Jain\\nVP,TSG\\n\\nMeetings between the student community and the VP TSG\\n\\nFirst meeting\\n\\nOn 19th March, 2014, the whole UG 1st year batch (students who joined in 2013) was called for a meeting at Netaji Auditorium at 6:30 pm. Apoorv Jain sent out this email at around 8 am that morning.\\n\\nThis meeting was attended by then Dean (Student Affairs) Prof N R Mandal, then President TSG Prof. Joy Sen, VP TSG Apoorv Jain and a few hall presidents. The turn out at the 6:30 pm meeting was very less. (approximately 50-70 people out of a total UG 1st year batch of 1400 people)\\n\\nThe meeting was delayed and students who were present there were intimidated into manually calling their friends to the venue, this marginally increased the turn out. The intimidation was done by the VP TSG who was present there, along with some fourth year hall presidents who were visibly angry and disappointed with the turnout. Absurd threats were made against the few obedient students who had turned up. Eg: \\nAgar tumhara pura batch yahan nahi aayega, to yahan pe jitne bhi log hain, tum sab pe DC baithegi. Phir udhar jaake jawaab de dena.\\n (If your whole batch doesn\\'t get here, all of you who are present here will be acted upon by the Disciplinary Committee. You can then explain your situation there.)\\n\\nAround 7:30 pm, the professors arrived at \\nNetaji Auditorium\\n. A long address followed. Students present at this meeting were informed that the 12 day delay was because of then DOSA Prof. N R Mandal being out of station and thus being unable to act on the events. This delay was not to be misinterpreted as an unwillingness to act. Allusions were also made to the VP, President and other professors of the institute getting phone calls from alumni regarding the MT Hall Day incident. One of the things that stood out at this meeting, which was discussed for several weeks after this meeting, was Prof. Joy Sen\\'s famous reference to the 1979 Mel Gibson classic \\nMad Max\\n. He particularly pointed out the end of the 1979 movie where Mel Gibson\\'s character Max loses control over himself, after losing his family, and kills several members of the gang that was involved in the death of his wife and his infant son. Prof. Sen\\'s was trying to draw an analogy between the behavior of a few out of control freshman and the protagonist in a movie who does something explicable, but rather bizarre. While most people at this first meeting had not seen the movie Prof. Sen was talking about, it was clear to almost everyone present that he was grappling with what had happened and trying to make sense of it using the appreciated principle of \"life imitating art\"\\n\\nStudents present there were also informed by the VP TSG that there was widespread disappointment in the behavior of the UG 1st year students, and that since the General Championships had been suspended right after the incident on 7th March, there was considerable anger among students in senior batches.\\n\\nAll professors present at the meeting were irritated with the low turnout and left about 1 hour after the meeting started in an agitated state. Apoorv Jain then decided to convene a complete UG 1st year batch meeting at 9 pm that night. There was widespread panic about what the consequences would be. There were several threats (such as mass Disciplinary Committee action, barring from placement, etc) which were indirectly made by the VP TSG and other hall presidents present at the meeting. The ultimatum was to get the whole batch at Netaji Auditorium at 9 pm and then, the discussion would be about the possible recourse that could be taken to mitigate the event\\'s fall out.\\n\\nSecond meeting\\n\\nThe second meeting began at 9 pm and saw much higher turnout, with almost the whole UG 1st year batch turning up. People were found in MMM and LBS Halls of residences literally running around calling their friends and everyone in 1st year to this meeting. There was widespread panic regarding the threats that had been made. Notably, none of the professors came to this meeting. The meeting was attended by the hall presidents of Patel, Nehru, MT, SN/IG, apart from then VP TSG. This was viewed as a scare tactic, as some of the hall presidents referred to the absence of Orientation Procedure / OP for first years was somehow responsible for this behavior. Their direct implication was that people were running around wild because they had not been \"trained in the ways of KGP\". Referring to the suspension of the GCs as a result of the main incident, one of the Hall Presidents said, \\nTum logon ko pata nahi hain ki iska kya matlab hain, sab log bahut gusse mein hain. Agle sal jab tum log senior hall jaoge to tumhe pata chalega\\n (You don\\'t know about the importance of the GCs being suspended, everyone is angry about this. You all will face the consequences for this next year, when you go to senior halls)\\n\\nSome of the options discussed in this meeting included a reduced community service for the whole UG 1st year batch, so as to save a few people from getting a lot of the punishment. When the students present in the auditorium were asked, \\nAre you all willing to take the blame and stay back and do community service for the summer, so that not just a few of your friends face really bad consequences?\\n, a few students immediately shot down the idea. The general consensus among students who had not attended the hall day, had not witnessed the incident, and/or were completely not involved in the incident was that they should not have to pay with their time for the mistakes of a few groups of people. \\n\\nThe VP TSG made an effort to try to get traction for the shared punishment idea. He asked if anyone would like to defend it and try to convince their batch mates. Understandably, students who had been spotted by many people as being the main players in the destruction were in total support of this idea of shared blame to reduce the punishment. They were seen visibly confused and voiced their concerns with one student standing up and addressing the rest of the auditorium: \\nDekh lo yaar, sab log lenge blame toh sirf ek mahina rehna padega, nahi toh pata nahi kya hoga.\\n (If everyone takes the blame, the punishment will be very less and everyone would have to stay back only for 1 month. If not, we don\\'t know what the punishment might be)\\n\\nTensions were even higher than at the previous meeting because for the first time Apoorv Jain said that one of the common punishments doled out after disciplinary committee hearings were \"semester backlogs\\n which implied that a student will be disbarred from registering for one semester and hence would be unable to complete their course on time. Apart from this, this would also be in the official record of the student including the final grade transcript.\\n\\nConsequence\\n\\nA group of 27 1st year students were told to undergo community service for 2 months during the summer months of May and June 2014. There was no other official record made anywhere regarding this event.\\n[\\nunverified\\n]\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThe events of MT Hall Day 2014 were a classic case of the Bandwagon effect. The destruction was started by a small subset of people attending the Hall Day. It started as a joke, and eventually turned into a competition between the various societies on campus.\\n\\nInterestingly, some of the women who resided in the hall, who were acting as hosts in the hall day decided to preclude the possibility of destruction by locking themselves inside their rooms and not letting anyone in. Some of the male friends of these women who had locked their doors to outsiders then tried to fish them out of there by filling buckets with water and then throwing them into the room using the slit under the door. It must be noted that a similar method is used to lure cockroaches out of hiding spots in kitchen drains, that must definitely have been the source of this particular strategy.\\n\\nWhile some other women decided to give in, and some even participated in the destruction of their friend\\'s rooms. Claims can also be made about this being a direct application of the herd behaviour in real life. There have been \\nseveral\\n riots in the past that have been attributed to this particular characteristic of human behaviour.\\n\\nOn a brighter side, there were people who were trying to stop this from happening. Shushman Choudhury (CS, \\'15) was on the ground floor and was trying to stop people from throwing down mattresses by shouting at them. He gave up after about 15 minutes of this (it was rather dangerous to stand on the ground floor where the possibility of a mattress hitting you is non-significant), but it must be said that it must have taken considerable courage to even try to do something like this against a mob, that for all practical purposes, had lost all control on themselves and had stopped computing the turn of events, the consequences of the same and the state of the hall as it stood around them.\\n\\nLess attention is paid to the aftermath and the administration\\'s response to this event. The administration decided to witch-hunt a small group of people and decided to get a list of names and proceed with punishing them. They decided to talk to the women whose rooms were trashed in an attempt to get the names of their male friends who did the trashing out of them. This strategy didn\\'t work out well at first. Most women flat out refused to talk. Soon, the administration started using the only chip they had: threatening the woman with disciplinary proceedings for not cooperating. Soon enough, it was clear to all the women that this was not going away and that they had to come up with names or get ready to face the heat of saving their friends.\\n\\nGiven a choice, several women chose to name a few friends who they thought would be wildly off the administration\\'s radar and it would be very hard to actually punish them because it would be obvious to everyone that these people were not responsible, but the administration didn\\'t care about this and went ahead and prepared the list of 40-50 people who were going to do the community service in the summer. This list had a few people who had been included because only the first name had been provided by the women and there were several people with that name in the UG batch. One such person got his father to fly out to Kharagpur and talk to the director directly about what was going on and why this kind of mob justice was being handed out. His name was removed from the list subsequently.\\n\\nThe names of some other people were also included in this list although their connection to the events was non-existent. People who had been at home during the weekend of the events or who had been in the hall for a very short period of time were on this list. Some people were able to get their names off the list.\\n\\nThe administration\\'s tactics were simple: they set about intimidating 18 year olds into tattling on their friends. While many might imagine that in the same situation, they would have behaved in an honorable manner, one is forced to imagine what the conditions must have been like if nearly 50 names could be squeezed out of a population of highly un-cooperative women.\\n\\nSee Also\\n\\nHall Day\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n↑\\n\\n\"Open Letter of Condemnation | MT Hall day\"\\n - VP TSG 2013-2014 Apoorv Jain\\n\\nRetrieved from \"\\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=2014-03-07_MT_Hall_Day_Incident&oldid=97174\\n\"', 'metadata': {'title': '2014-03-07 MT Hall Day Incident', 'url': 'https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/2014-03-07_MT_Hall_Day_Incident', 'timestamp': '2025-02-04 11:23:18', 'source_type': 'wiki_entry'}}\n",

When these boarders went to cast their votes in the evening, they were told \\ntumhara vote daal diya hain, abhi chale jao\\n.\\n\\nInforming the election coordinator\\n\\nAfter noticing this, an application was written by one of the fourth years from Azad Hall. This application was signed by ~16 people from the hall who faced the same situation. This application was submitted in person to the election coordinator for the year.\\n\\nNo further action was taken.\\n\\nAftermath\\n\\nThe elections, which elected Shovan Panigrahi as the Vice President of Gymkhana, were considered to be valid. No re-elections were organized.\\n\\nFrom the next election season, i.e from Spring 2017, voting was centralized. All students are now required to go to the Gymkhana or one of the other polling centers to cast their vote.

The IIT Kharagpur branch of 180 Degrees Consulting (abbreviated as 180DC) was founded in April 2020 by Amritash Bharadwaj, Nikita Kishore, Adarsh Gupta, Aniket Shah and Keshav Godala with an aim to provide quality consultancy services to socially conscious corporations and NGOs to help them achieve the impact they seek to create.\\n\\nBeing students of the oldest, largest and most versatile of IITs, the team consists of driven and capable people with diverse skill sets across various fields.

Good knowledge of business and finance is appreciated but is not the main factor of evaluation. We expect an optimal amount of time and dedication. \\n\\nKnowledge Meetings\\n\\nThe main opportunity to learn in 180 Degrees Consulting is via knowledge meetings. Seniors organise knowledge meetings to polish the skills of new recruits and also teach them various consulting techniques and frameworks. These knowledge meetings also involve case study competitions/workshops.\\n\\nOrganisational Structure\\n\\nAdvisors\\n consist of fourth and fifth-year members and are the senior-most members whose experience helps in guiding the overall direction of the organisation.\\n\\nDirectors\\n are members who are in their third and fourth year of study.

      "content=\"<think>\\nOkay, so I have this question about whether someone with a CGPA of 7.3 can register for an Additional Subject. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I know that CGPA stands for Cumulative Grade Point Average. It's like the average grade someone has earned up to a certain point in their academic career. So if someone has a CGPA of 7.3, they're pretty high. But does that mean they can take an Additional Subject?\\n\\nI remember that some universities have specific rules about this. I think it depends on whether they're applying for undergraduate or postgraduate programs. For undergrads, I believe you need to have a CGPA of at least 4.0. So if someone has 7.3, they should be fine.\\n\\nBut wait, what about postgraduates? I'm not sure. Maybe the requirement is different there. Let me check my notes or textbooks. Oh right, for postgraduates, it might still require a CGPA of around 4.0 or higher. So even if someone is in grad school, having a CGPA of 7.3 should be okay.\\n\\nAnother thing to consider is the Additional Subject requirement. I think some universities allow you to take an extra subject beyond your main degree. But again, it depends on the program. If they require a certain CGPA for that, then maybe not everyone can register. However, if the school doesn't have such a strict requirement, especially if it's a general education course, then 7.3 should be enough.\\n\\nI also wonder about the grading system. Some schools use a different scale than others. If they're using a 4-point scale, 7.3 is way above average. But if it's a 5-point scale, maybe that's still acceptable. I'm not sure how CGPA is calculated in their specific program.\\n\\nWait, another point: sometimes universities have a policy where you can take an Additional Subject only after completing your degree. So even with a high CGPA, if they don't allow it yet, you might need to wait until you finish. But the question doesn't mention that, so I think it's assuming you're applying for registration now.\\n\\nAlso, some schools might have specific rules about how many Additional Subjects you can take. If there are restrictions, then even with a high CGPA, you might not be eligible. But without knowing the specifics of the school, it's hard to say.\\n\\nIn summary, if the school allows Additional Subjects and doesn't have strict CGPA requirements beyond 4.0 or similar, someone with 7.3 should be able to register. However, I'm not entirely sure about all the details, so maybe I should check a few universities' websites or contact their admissions office for clarification.\\n</think>\\n\\nBased on the thought process and considerations outlined:\\n\\n- **Undergraduate Programs**: A CGPA of 7.3 is typically acceptable for undergraduate programs requiring at least a CGPA of 4.0.\\n\\n- **Postgraduate Programs**: The requirement may vary, but generally, a CGPA of around 4.0 or higher is sufficient unless specific policies apply.\\n\\n- **Additional Subject Registration**: If the school allows Additional Subjects and does not have strict CGPA requirements beyond 4.0, someone with a CGPA of 7.3 should be eligible.\\n\\n- **Universities-Specific Rules**: It's important to check each university's specific policy regarding CGPA for Additional Subjects and registration restrictions.\\n\\n**Conclusion**: If the school allows Additional Subjects and does not have strict CGPA requirements beyond 4.0, someone with a CGPA of 7.3 should be able to register. However, it's advisable to verify this directly with the target university.\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'model': 'deepseek-r1:1.5b', 'created_at': '2025-02-24T15:04:38.2445254Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 14410045800, 'load_duration': 19814800, 'prompt_eval_count': 31, 'prompt_eval_duration': 25000000, 'eval_count': 772, 'eval_duration': 14362000000, 'message': Message(role='assistant', content='', images=None, tool_calls=None)} id='run-9be2eb14-4a6a-4705-8c75-ca2a5e468b2f-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 31, 'output_tokens': 772, 'total_tokens': 803}\n"

      "content='<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out the CG criteria for an interdisciplinary program. Hmm, I\\'m not entirely sure what that means. Let me start by breaking down the terms.\\n\\nFirst, \"CG\" probably stands for something like \"Curriculum Guidelines,\" but maybe it\\'s more specific. Interdisciplinary programs combine different fields of study, so maybe the CG needs to reflect that. I think curriculum guidelines usually outline course requirements and learning objectives. So, for an interdisciplinary program, those would need to be tailored to integrate multiple disciplines.\\n\\nI remember seeing something about academic units or departments in universities having their own guidelines. Maybe each department has its own CG criteria. That makes sense because different fields might have different expectations for what\\'s important. For example, a biology department might require more lab work and experiments, while a computer science department might focus on coding and technology.\\n\\nI should also consider how the interdisciplinary program itself is structured. It probably requires students to take courses from multiple departments or units. So, the CG criteria would need to ensure that these courses are integrated properly. Maybe there\\'s a specific number of required courses from each discipline, or perhaps some electives that allow flexibility within the interdisciplinary framework.\\n\\nAnother thing to think about is how assessments work. In an interdisciplinary program, exams might be more comprehensive since students have to demonstrate understanding across multiple subjects. The CG criteria would need to outline how these assessments are conducted and evaluated.\\n\\nI also wonder about the workload. Interdisciplinary programs can be challenging because they require balancing knowledge from different areas. So, the CG criteria might include guidelines on course load, time commitment per week or semester, and any additional responsibilities students might have outside of academics.\\n\\nMaybe there\\'s a focus on critical thinking and problem-solving skills since it\\'s interdisciplinary. The curriculum should encourage students to apply knowledge across disciplines to solve complex problems. That would mean including projects or case studies that require integrating information from various fields.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure about the specific percentages for each discipline, but I think they might be set by the academic units themselves. For example, a biology and chemistry department might allocate 40% of their curriculum to biology courses, while a computer science department could have 30%. The interdisciplinary program would then integrate these into its overall structure.\\n\\nAlso, there might be a requirement for a certain number of credit hours from each discipline. If the interdisciplinary program is 120 credit hours, maybe 48 from biology, 36 from chemistry, and 36 from computer science. That way, it\\'s balanced across all areas.\\n\\nI should also consider any specific courses or electives that are part of the interdisciplinary requirement. These might include capstone projects, research papers, or collaborative assignments where students work across disciplines.\\n\\nIn terms of learning outcomes, the CG criteria would outline what students should know and be able to do after completing the program. This includes not only knowledge from each discipline but also the ability to integrate information and apply it in new contexts.\\n\\nI\\'m a bit fuzzy on how assessments are handled. Are they based on participation, projects, exams, or a combination? The CG criteria would need to specify this so that everyone understands how student performance is evaluated.\\n\\nLastly, I think there might be a focus on developing soft skills like teamwork and communication since it\\'s an interdisciplinary program. The curriculum should encourage collaboration across different fields and present students with opportunities to work together on projects.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the CG criteria for an interdisciplinary program would likely include specific course requirements from each discipline, balanced workload, integration of knowledge across areas, critical thinking, assessments that evaluate a range of skills, and a focus on teamwork and communication. Each academic unit might have its own set of guidelines to ensure consistency and effectiveness.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe curriculum guidelines (CG) for an interdisciplinary program are structured to integrate knowledge from multiple disciplines, ensuring students develop comprehensive skills. Here\\'s a concise breakdown:\\n\\n1. **Course Requirements**: Each discipline within the program must contribute a specific number of credit hours. For example, biology might account for 40%, chemistry 30%, and computer science 30%.\\n\\n2. **Workload**: The interdisciplinary program balances academic load with practical application.

      "Okay, so I need to figure out how the food in PFC at IIT KGP is. Let me start by recalling what I know. I've heard that IIT KGP is an engineering college, and they have a hostel called PFC. The question is about their food service.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should think about what I know regarding hostel food services. Typically, hostels offer different types of meals throughout the day. Maybe breakfast, lunch, dinner, and maybe even snacks in between. I remember that some hostels have a fixed menu or a rotating schedule where they serve different dishes each meal time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also recall that many hostels have a policy about backlogs. If there's a backlog, it usually means students are waiting for meals because the previous meal wasn't served on time. So, if PFC is their hostel, I should check if they have any such policies or if everyone gets their meal promptly without any issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another point to consider is whether the food service is consistent throughout the day. Some hostels might serve breakfast late in the morning and dinner early in the evening, which could be a problem for students who arrive late. But I think PFC might try to accommodate that by having flexible schedules or offering meals at different times if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also think about any special provisions for students. Maybe there are discounts or packages for certain groups like seniors or students with health issues. It's possible that PFC offers a variety of options, including vegetarian or non-vegetarian options, depending on the student's dietary needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, I wonder if PFC has any facilities to ensure food safety and quality. Perhaps they have trained staff, clean areas, and maybe even some amenities like tables for students to sit at during meals. This would make it easier for students to eat comfortably without worrying about food issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider the time of day when students arrive. If PFC is open 24 hours or has a late-night option, that could be an advantage. But if they close early, maybe students have to wait longer for meals. I think many hostels do offer late-night options, so that might not be a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the food in PFC at IIT KGP likely includes a variety of meal times throughout the day, with consistent service and possibly some flexibility for students who arrive late or need special meals. They probably have policies to handle backlogs and ensure quality, along with any necessary facilities to make dining convenient.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The food service at PFC, the hostel of IIT KGP, is designed to provide a comprehensive and flexible dining experience. Here's an organized overview:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Meal Schedule**: \n",
      "   - PFC offers breakfast, lunch, dinner, and may also include snacks during different meal times throughout the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Backlog Management**:\n",
      "   - The hostel likely has policies in place to handle backlogs, accommodating students who arrive late by offering flexible schedules or providing meals at various times if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consistency and Quality**:\n",
      "   - Food is typically prepared with a fixed menu or rotating options, ensuring variety and quality for all students.\n",
      "   - PFC may offer special provisions such as discounts or packages for seniors or those with dietary needs, enhancing the dining experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Facilities**:\n",
      "   - The hostel likely has trained staff, clean areas, and amenities to ensure food safety and comfort, including late-night options if available.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Time of Day**:\n",
      "   - PFC may offer 24-hour service or late-night options, accommodating students who arrive late without compromising on meal quality.\n",
